We were not welcome with a smile from the guy at the reception and also most all the waiters (there's only one great guy which serve the dish)  2. Ambience was ok but there's a weird smell. There's a dusty + mouldy smell on the 2nd for where we were seated.  3.  The taste of the FOOD WAS very flat. My linguine tasted like oil and the spaghetti is just like something you can get from a frozen spaghetti. Salad was totally like a mixed of  leftover vegetables.  4. It's feel unpleasant to be seated so near to the basin.  Just not worthy to dine here.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHanQyNnFBRRAB,The taste was normal and is pretty overpriced. Having to queue for such a long time to get to try this was not really worth it but it is still not too bad for an egg sandwich.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHLXV6VE1BEAE,"Can't recommend it enough. Out of the things I tried, my number one pick has to be their truffle hashbrowns. Absolutely amazing. The flavour was just right; not too pungent or salty. Their salted chocolate chip cookie is delectable too.

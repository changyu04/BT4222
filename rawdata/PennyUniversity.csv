ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjkybmNREAE,The general experience and atmosphere was a very positive one and the food was good. But I was disappointed in the service at our table. I felt like there was no effort to make the customer happy and I was even made fun of after not understanding the mumbled words of the service staff.

Coffee came hot, strong and full of aroma. They have an excellent variety of brunch food as well. Sat at the bar counter and enjoyed my time there. When I visited yesterday, there was a collaboration with Tanamera coffee. So there was free tasting of their capsules. The owner/boss was really friendly and shared that they will start to serve dinner during Ramadan month. Food will be more African style. He even showed us the menu.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpdE1MMXdRRRAB,More like Penny Dreadful!  Service that is. I'm sure the coffee and food may be good but we waited 45mins after being seated outside (even though they let another couple in before us - zero waiting system in place) and no one cane out to take the order.  Ended up leaving.

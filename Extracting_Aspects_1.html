/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<pre>Took my son there for dinner and we had a good time. We both ate a Philly cheese steak and it was really good. Service was good, girls are very pleasant and pay attention to the service, prices are very reasonable.
Pathetic food. Ordered vegetarian burger. Tasted awful. Potato wedges were cut so big and didn’t taste good.  Also beware that happy hour beer costs more than regular ones.
Friendly staff, superb service, food was serve hot and fresh, not so pricey, pretty service staff. Place is a bit outdated might needs some upgrading. But overall experience is 5star
I have yet to find a Hooter&#39;s that I didn&#39;t like. Cold beer, hot wings.
Alcohol is expensive everywhere in Singapore, so I went to Hooters. The chicken is delicious and there are things to see. There was a beer 2+1 promotion, and it was nice to take pictures with the staff as if I was going to a Japanese Mate Cafe.
Lovely bar, super friendly staff and smiling too. Good, as usual, was lovely, good offers on beer BOGO or BTGO. Pitched alongside Clarke&#39;s Quay and has seating on the river edge too. Nice music, great decor  Will with dropping in to see the menu and nibbles
After their renovation, the food quality has dropped significantly. The calamari was cold and greasy, without salt. The music was boring, being played on a poor quality music system in a corner.
Lunchtime so quite but everything else great
This is the place I entered after wandering around the neighborhood to take a river cruise. I didn&#39;t originally intend to have dinner here, but I don&#39;t  …
Very good food, best place to wait, till the rivercruise starts! Very good Slush of the day, I had orange.
Great service. Super clean. Food came out quick. Food was good but doesnt taste like American original recipes but wasnt bad tasting.
The menu only indicates on the cover (!) Page that all drinks are +10% Service fee +8% GST. Some Drinks said ++ so we thought that only those drinks had the +18% charge… in the end, the +18% was on the entire bill. What a scam…
Alcohol is expensive everywhere, so I can&#39;t help it,  …
Good food, cold beer, reasonably priced and the staff were great.
The clerk is …
Nice food and portions as well. Ambience was good along riverside although 1 hot waitress was very direct when asked for riverside view to say on the face a big nooooooooo, but that was covered by other waitresses by their welcome gesture and service.
Don&#39;t expect too much for the taste of the …
Wings were awesome as always!
Good wings
Not so bad
Horrible experience in this Hooters Singapore.. Owner should change the staff and manager in this restaurant. All very rude .. …

Unfortunately, you can only sit outside after 6 p.m. - I think it used to be different. I didn&#39;t eat anything, but I was immediately offered a large beer - 0.5l, which is why it took a while - at the happy hour price and then another one. Service very friendly. It&#39;s better to sit at the table than at the counter, especially …
Food wasn&#39;t that great. it could have been but overcooked.
Uneatable food
Went for late night dinner. Sat besides the canal. Service was quick. Had ordered chicken wings and fries along with beer.
Food was good as usual but taste quality was a bit downgrade.
Came here to have some appetisers before the Clarke Quay river cruise and it was quite nice, they had quick service and pretty good quality potato starters. Ambience is also pleasant! :)
I like a beer  …
Good service, got the shrimp tacos and wings, the food tasted really good. Well seasoned and reasonably portioned for the price. …
The music is too loud to communicate with the waitresses. The waitresses don&#39;t speak or understand English effectively. Took a wrong order and refused to change it.
Delicious
the food is pretty good for the beef and fish, the service is good with the lady who is dressed very sexy, can sit by the river
They don&#39;t have appetizers, only drinks. &#34;Cool&#34; environment, rec …

Was very average, not really busy and boring.
Staffs are all great..staff My is doing awesome .. and always attentive on all tables around her..
Good location but ordinary restaurant.
Overpriced beer
I just came here because the other places had a long queue. To be honest, it is quite a lovely place. If you&#39;re looking for somewhere with short queue and isn&#39;t too noisy.
Paid $90 for a meal and drinks and had to pay extra just to get a glass of water. What a joke!
The tacos and other items were good. The service needs huge improvements especially the person seating the customers. Very slow to clear the tables.
I&#39;m a fussy eater and I loved their beef burger!
Foods was good service was good
Their signature wings is a must try.
Good ambience , nice and friendly staff , for food good in display but not good in taste. We are having Baby back ribs and Chicken Wings , and both are not recomended or maybe not suitable with us ☺️( was having it on 28/09 around 7 pm )
Good！
Love it.. Chiken wings with butter garlic sauce
Love the wings!
Ok if you can understand the staff.
Nice and good
Hooters and other dining establishments are located along the River Valley Road. One of the is Tsui Wah. Hooters is a bar and restaurant. You can have beer or spirits and enjoy the food. Also the servers wear sexy attire, as a Hooters tradition. Chicken wings is a must try.
Nice place to have a nice meal with friends and family. Nice cosy ambience.  They had recently reopen for lunch  which was done with earlier this year due to …
More than 4 but not 5. Service ok. Location nice and relaxing. Food good.
Always a go to when in need of garlic spice chicken wings, beers and.. more
The food was average, the chicken wings were not juicy. The service was not so great, the waitress were not rude but they were not very welcome and would not even smile.
Food is good, service is not. Took 10 minutes just to get my drink after the food arrived. Way under staffed and management doesn&#39;t care. It isn&#39;t the waitresses fault, but still service needs to improve.
Highly understaffed.  The waitresses couldn&#39;t be less bothered to ensure you have a clean and a good meal. The place gives a very unsanitized feeeling.  The food was very below average with most of the items being just fried.  Wouldnt go there again ever.
Best chicken wings of all the places we have tried. Also cheaper than other resturants around the area.
Usually crowded on weekends since lifting of covid-19 restrictions. Currently, understaffed and expect long waiting for outdoor seating and food to be served..
Waitress are great .....Beer was cheap......Nice Buffalo wing
The chicken wings are still good. Was sitted outside and it wasn&#39;t that busy. …

Service was efficient and friendly. Medium wings (1 flame) had almost no spice but were buttery and rich as promised while still maintaining a light crispy crust. Wings were also evenly and sufficiently coated.
tasty chicken wings
Normally food but expensive price
Nothing so special than other Bars or Cafe. But goof Ambience, you can sit for a long time.
Nice ambience by the side of the river. Good starters along with Heineken beer Tower.
Place was not bad and service given by the manager named selena &amp; one of the girl working there that i forgot her name is good after i pay a visit to this place again🤔😎 …

The buffalo wings is awesome and the beer set I think was reasonable. However the service could be better. Some staff was good and some was not happy to be there. I don&#39;t know if they are overworked or just tired, regardless customer service should always be on point.
The place is a charm. The food is good and fresh beer from the tap is a must try. But the biggest negative is their staff. The waitresses are very rude. They don&#39;t know how to behave with customers and don&#39;t even know English. If someone doesn&#39;t go there for a second time, that would be solely due to guest experience.
First time to Hooters and encountered very bad experience with the service staff, Laura. Firstly, she was giving a reluctant attitude to take our orders. Me and friend ordered 10 PCs of wings and a nachos. The wings came in 4 plates with 5 …
Horrible service! If you are that unhappy working then quit! Complete opposite experience to the original in the US. Complete fail. Better to go somewhere else.
Laura certainly aint for Hooters. No energy. No charisma. Just a dead soul serving.2nd time here n she just the same lifeless. Very bad reputation for such a great place
Unfortunately this hooters was a disappointment...it was on Singapore and we were surprised that the quality of their food was not very good.
Not enough service staff
Juat so so..
Always wanted to try Hooters.  Food was good . Cocktails cheap for the area. Great location.
Overpriced cafeteria food, that couldn&#39;t even cook chicken proper. Run away
Nice chill out by the river. Like the finger food Poh Piang.
Ambience and food was so different compared with Taipei branch. Buffalo platter taste weird ( like plastic), feels like the paste is not fresh. Mojito way too sweet... …
Ex …
Great place to chilled! Suggest to add on something new in the menu...
Chicken wings were on point!  After trying Hooters in Thailand I was slightly apprehensive but it was so much better in Singapore. The staff were very attentive too
Beef sliders were tasty, can’t go wrong with wings and tater tots.  The menu said the tater tots were slightly smaller than Mt Everest, but it was barely as big as Fort Canning Park.
Service so so
👌 …
👌 …
Still love their buffalo wings.
Didn’t give all the food menu until requested. Food quality is so so and service is bad.
Everything was satisfactory except the staff service. Staff make mistake yet manager in-charge trying to challenge the customers omg
Fast food type of food with normal prices, and acceptable quality. Not the best place for a date or a professional dinner.
Food and the Belgian beer is nice. One of the staff forgot my sauce, hence the 4 star
One of the best F&amp;B i have been dine in😍😍 …
Ambiance is good. Quality and quantity of the food is well maintained and worth the price. Wings with spice options provided are not that spicy. Service is slow and not customer friendly. The 1+1 Beer offering was good enough.
Good food fast service and very affordable
The girls doesnt seems to be comfortable and i think they need more training to mingle with customers
Great service! The staffs are super friendly and willingly to recommend what is good here! Good location, enjoying the nice view by the river.
Busy place and some waiting time, the food was good.
Always come back for their chicken wings 👍🏻 …
Food was not good, especially the 2 chicken dishes we ordered. Chicken was hard and dry.
Ambience at Clarke Quay is just so so when I was there a week ago. Could probably be due badly hit by C19 endemic.
Great service
Only place open for mid arvo beers. Post Covid
Open until midnight only
15 minutes to take the order another 40 minutes to prepare the food. Disappointing.
Came here with my colleagues during lunch break. The customer service here is very good and the lunch set is very value for money. The food was very filling and very delicious too. Will definitely recommend to friends and family. I’ll come back for more :)
Great food, topped off by friendly service by Kiki. Kudos!
Food and drink up to standard but not so friendly service.
Reasona …
A great place go chill out and enjoy the beer. The waitress are hot and sexy. The place outdoor area is just beside the river and u can enjoy the view of the clark quay river. There are also a variety of food and beers in the menu. A great place to hang out and chill with friends.
Food portions are big so worth the price. Wings could have had more flavour though, took the original hooters style with the medium flavour. Was shown to be spicy but there was no spice at all. …

Well done hooters. Requested for medium well but was given raw meat. Food was tasteless. If I could I would’ve given zero stars
Slow service, many menu items unavailable. Not up to expected standards.

Ordered a Buffalo Platter to share with friends over beers. The food is ok, albeit not very memorable. We sat outside along the Singapore River. It was a nice cool evening with an amazing view.
Slow service. Nice view. Average food. Good beer deals
Food is good but service should have been better. The server aren&#39;t friendly and not in a mood for service.
The first Hooters in Southeast Asia. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll be the last too. The atmosphere was depressing. And the food barely edible.
Not par with the expectation, huge scope of improvement. Tacos were epic and so were the wings
First time in hooters , Service was bad ,specially the girl name Laura ,So rude . The Wings was great ,beside of that , the Food was fine . …
Good for Western food.
My 2nd time here and so far so good the waitresses were good as well😊 …

The wings are amazingly delicious! Just the right amount of crisp with some spicy sauce, every bite was a delightful bit of heaven. …
all the staff are nice except for the filipina manager who is very rude and not accomodating at all. you will feel that you are not welcome at all. she needs more training.
Good service n good food.
Back to Hooters after many years. Cycle pass two weeks ago, but only take out that time. Cycle pass again yesterday, decided to had my lunch. Remember trying the wings years ago and really love it, so I had wings yesterday, never failed me. It is so delicious, set meal come with drink and ice cream.
out of everything we ordered cream pasta was the best and also relatively affordable ($15.99+$2.30(bacon)++); flavour was rich and loved the texture! The Daytona wings and buffalo tacos were alright, place is definitely better suited as a …

American style food whereby portions are big and mostly deep fried. Place was pretty empty for a Friday night.
Dismal service, one of the worst pint of Guinness, highly overpriced.
Not our last time coming here. We&#39;ve always return for their signature Daytona wings with blue cheese dip. They come in different levels of spiciness.. We&#39;ve tried 9-mile(mucus draining 😀) and 3-mile( this a gd enough level if spiciness.. …
Outstanding Service 😃 …
The Baja fish tacos and chicken tacos were bomb!! Highly recommended on Friday nights.
Forgive the lack of food pictures... service was good and prompt. The set lunch menu is definitely worth it. Best time would be during lunch as there is hardly any crowd. Apologies for being stuck in the past but i was surprised to see families bringing their little kids and babies to dine there as well.
All Hooters are awesome haha
Lovely ambience !!

1st time , food was good - ambience nice ! 1:1 on certain beers (corona eg.) and free meals with 2 mains ordered (we chose desert). Will be back.
Very cozy

Nice food. Not crowded
I left my Ray Ban there and they sent it to me after I paid the postage. Class service! Location, food and the girls are great. Not exactly cheap, but that&#39;s not Singapore anyway.
Decent environment. Pleasant meal. Some LGBT people serving at cash register. A few eye candies serving meals. Cooking not bad. Meh! It&#39;s alright though...
Oh yeah... Servicers are nice and they are from nearby countries, which is a plus!
Was promised to have a 1 for 1 beer prior to entering, when ordering was told that there isnt any
Reasonable pricing, good food, nice ambience &amp; most important of all, excellent service provided by Charmen &amp; Sammi. …
1 4 1 deal is wonderful!
one for one available.. food is great.. girls are hot with pants smaller than my underwear.. sexy..
Not so bad. But the priced had increased after covid. The fish and chip that i had wasnt that great.
Terrible service from Filipino lady. Keeps on looking at us
Delicious wings as always with an awesome view of the... River 😁 …
Wings i ordered were not spicy and coated in too much batter which ruined the wings.
Closes at 10 pm during pandemic. Food and drinks are just fine.
Terrible service. Came here on 14 nov at 7.30pm. A short service staff in blue jersey uniform blatantly ignored us not once but twice when we want to order food. Not that she is very busy, she just stood at the counter there. Not that she …
Generous serving size and friendly staff
The breasts are flatter here compared to the US outlets. Decent food and prices.
Had the fried food platter. Taste was ok, but didn&#39;t quite satisfy and left me wanting. I doubt I&#39;ll come here again unless I want something I can&#39;t get anywhere else. …

Not a hooter joint...unfriendly . The fun factor is dead here
Food was good. Having 1 for 1 promo now
Cheapest beer in Clarke Quay on the edge of the canal with fairly free smoking area, on the other hand do not take hard alcohol drinks because there are none inside! Otherwise sexy waitresses like in all Hooters.
Food was fantastic. Ambience was good. Always a good place to chill.
Nice place for lunch
Cheaper than astons because of their 141 - fried pickles are DAMN GOOD. 911 fried chicken wings aren’t spicy or sour but still good!
Great food, 1 for 1 promo is great value, will visit again
Nice place in the center of Clark Quay. Will take a seat by the riverside and enjoy the breeze.  You will love some of the dishes. I loved the chicken breast strips dipped in spicy garlic sauce. Also the most always we order is the spring …
If you like American HOT Wings, this is the place to go. Pretty close in Mexican food. Not so typical Hooters waiters like US but hey you can’t complain.
Awesome prawn tacos
food is surprisingly better than decent
Old school music ambience, great service,  good place for a drink to chill and hang with friends
1 for 1 deal is a bargain! Friendly staff and reasonably nice food.

This is the place in Clark Quay to go for a cool beer &amp; delicious wings (try Garlic Habanero) by riverside. The girls are friendly &amp; provided an excellent service. Food is great and cocktails are amazing. Saw some families eating with kids too.
Great wings. I was surprised by the waitress staff do dance shows during the time. Too busy eating and watch the girls to take photos.
Great food and excellent service. The portions are substantial and tastes good. The servers are friendly and attentive. The lunch specials are particularly good value for money and is great for a family.

The waiter gave gender preference treatment. Ella was our waitress.
Unfortunately not as I know it from the USA. At least one pretty waitress would have been nice, my wife says. Compared to the restaurants right next to it, the prices are really steep. WiFi is only available on the terrace outside, none inside.
Taste is not up to the mark
appetizers and main course served at the same time
Very nice place!Awesome!🤗 …
The only positive thing here was the location and the seating area outdoor. The staff was a bit annoyed and the prices high (like almost anywhere in Singapore), the food was disappointing.
Good place to grab a bite and some drinks with friends
The service is terrible. The waitresses were too busy gossiping and not paying attention to the customers.

Beautiful chicken strips :)
Good food, friendly staff and some of the best prices on beer. The atmosphere really gets going around 10pm
Great location and great food with  friendly staff   would go back
Good food and nice river views. Same as every other tens of restaurants in the same area.
Very good....as alway …
Love the food. Yummyy..
We were looking for a place to eat late at night. Looked pretty attractive from outside however the price for food and drinks didn&#39;t meet our expectations. However I think it would an average experience at any other place based on the river bank. Music could be a bit more modern. In overall not a bad place for pre drinks
Food is very good and staff is very friendly, just been very confused on split bill between people and had to change it 3 times
Nice place to chill out..

Friend gave me 1 for 1 wings voucher so went with family to try out. I find the service is pretty bad. At least not the typical American restaurant like Hard Rock cafe. …
Lunch menu is good quality &amp; very reasonably priced
Ordered daltona sauce chicken wings. Loved it👍 …
The location is the best thing there and food and drinks are not too expensive. Bang in the middle of all the action on the riverside.
The view of the Singapore River is great. The chairs are a bit shaky. The service is very nice and accommodating. The food was plentiful and delicious!
Delicious food
Great food and Ambience!!
Great service and food.

Wings oh wings.. you gotta love it!
Good value lunch set. Comfortable dinning place, despite the name it is a decent place to catch up with a friend over a meal. Saw several tourists including family having lunch there.
Very crowded
Cool place!
Perfect place to enjoy a coconut cocktail on Clarke Quay. Friendly service!
Food wasn&#39;t great, service was good.
Nachos is the best. Don&#39;t order mixed grill.
The view is good. Good food and waitresses too :-)
It was okay. Music was annoying loud as they were trying to drown out the live band right next door.  It&#39;s right on the river, so it would have been more enjoyable and peaceful without the techno mix blasting at the tables.
Good place to just chill. A pill costly pizza was pathetic
Asia hooters. Food similar to us. But not the best style inside reaturant. Outside very good. Voew over river

Nothing special
Well you know.  Just a very nice spot!.
Nice place for happy hour and during 10pm there had dancers....
Hooters is a pubbing area in the Downtown of Singapore. Surrounded by water body and Clarke Quay Central Mall, this is a covered sit out for food and drinks. I liked this place very much.
Saturday night was fun.. Great ambience and location..
Great atmosphere and view along the river. Brilliant staff and nice tasty food. The ice cream was a bonus.
The most unforgettable chicken strip I’ve ever had!

Nice place to chill..
Great environment but thought the food was a bit average based on other locations. Good vide by the river.
Great food. Sticky wings. Very nice location at night.
Fun, well located.
Great selection of food and drinks.  Very clean restaurant and staff extremely friendly.
The samurai chicken wings is good! And probbaly one of the few places you can talk in Clarke Quay
cool
My kind of place
It&#39;s good. Burgers are delicious, it&#39;s not expensive and beer is definitely good there.
I was so disappointed with Hooters. They served this horrible soda water with lime and claim it to be a cocktail. When we went to complain they refuse to listen.
Love all the foods here, and all the waitress is so hot !!
If you know Hooters in US you will be a little bit disappointed the taste doesn&#39;t match but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not good service will be better with more smiles but girls are nice

Portion is very generous.
We seem to have a lot of business meetings here.  Great place to sit by the river on a Friday afternoon.  All the usual Hooters fare.  And Clark Quay is a great entertainment and dining venue.
God the girls are below standard with the price paid definitely not worth it
The Hooters has a very good location on the famous Clarke Quay - with great views of the Singapore River, but the prices to match, especially for the drinks. The service is very good, the food definitely okay. I can recommend a visit!

Third time in here in two weeks. We waited over 30 minutes to order food, even then we had to wave the waitress down. Sunday evening so not exactly busy. Seems the quiter the night the worse the service is. …
Delicious food and good service.
Never been to a Hooters before so thought  I’d give it a try. The chicken was good although really thick greasy batter - nearly died after reading how many calories were in just one. The milkshake was nice hence the 2 but they also served my partner his meal and brought my drink and meal when he was basically finished.
The wings are good
The same, as it should be, wherever you go. Great if you don&#39;t want to search for something to eat and not know what your getting.
Drinks are OK... the waiters are not hooters standard :(

Taste: Probably my top 3 pasta places in SG considering most places cannot do it well. Their pesto pasta was quite good. Burrata was fresh though slightly small for its price. Good for celebration but I do find the food slightly salty and oily end of the meal, not for regular dining.  Cost: $100+ for 3 pax  Waiting time: 20 minutes  Overall: 4/5
Had some really nice meals here while it was still open mid 2022. Enjoyed the airiness and char of the pizza.
Amazing Italian food! You can taste the freshness of their pasta. We asked our waiter to surprise us with a pizza and pasta, let’s just say it did not disappoint. We live in Hawaii and are still dreaming of the meal we ate there. It was so good I forgot to take photos of my meals😅
Great place for a great meal. Food is delicious, service is excellent and atmosphere is cozy. Price is also reasonable. 👍🏻😃 …
Unpleasant dining experience here.  1. We were not welcome with a smile from the guy at the reception and also most all the waiters (there&#39;s only one great guy which serve the dish)  2. Ambience was ok but there&#39;s a weird smell. There&#39;s a dusty + mouldy smell on the 2nd for where we were seated.  3.  The taste of the FOOD WAS very flat. My linguine tasted like oil and the spaghetti is just like something you can get from a frozen spaghetti. Salad was totally like a mixed of  leftover vegetables.  4. It&#39;s feel unpleasant to be seated so near to the basin.  Just not worthy to dine here. Should have read the reviews before we came.
I must say.. THE FRUTTI DI MARE IS INSANELY GOOD.  The staff here are very friendly and helpful. Definitely would come back. 🥹
We had a lovely dinner at Cicheti. The pizza there never fails. Special mention goes to the polpo. It was flavorful and the texture was perfect! We ended our dinner with the cocoa cake.
Exceptional food, relaxing ambience in the restraunt, highly recommend.
Pizza base and crust was abit raw/doughy
Ordered a bunch of dishes from Oddle and they were all A+. Including the delivery service from Lalamove.
Nice cosy place. Had 2 pizzas and would recommend the Quattro Formaggi. Also enjoyed the Clams Linguine.
Highly recommended 5 stars for their pizzas, Carpaccio and Focaccia. But not for their Espresso. The firewood oven created one of the most memorable pizzas and Focaccia generous with fresh olive oil. Ingredients are fresh and overall taste …
2nd time here. The 1st time was a very quick lunch. This round I got a table indoors and had more time to look through the menu. The staff member was very attentive to suggest tweaks for a more kids friendly option, like having pepperoni in …
Love the pizza here! We ordered one Napoletana and one Salsiccia. Both are amazing, good dough with fresh ingredients. Also ordered Brussel sprouts, normally I don&#39;t like the bitter taste of it, but they cooked it with sweet sauce and some …
We first went on impulse to have good pizza.. and boy did this place deliver. Food is always tip top... I&#39;m inlove with every single item on their menu..(yes we have tried them all) that&#39;s how often we go.. super friendly and helpful staff …
Can’t go wrong with Cicheti, food was delicious, and service was good. We had a little bit of (almost) everything on the menu, from appetiser to pasta, pizza and dessert. Would recommend the Bucatini Amatriciana and Linguine pastas, and Sopressata and Carbonara pizza.
Great pizzas at a good price point. Lovely dough, high quality toppings.
Small cozy Italian restaurant serving a vast array of dishes. I tried the pasta amatriciana and the pizza salsiccia and they were both incredible! Really impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the preparation. It has two floors and two tables outside too.
Every good for location and bog will happy enjoy this place 🥰 …
The pizza was fantastic! Chef noted that we need something tomato based and vegetarian. He handcrafted something unique for us 👍🏻 steak was great too! …
Wood fire Pizza very very very good. Must eat fresh and warm. We were lucky to have a seat without booking. Very crowded and popular. Service is very fast. Vegetarian options available too. Meat and non vegetarian also available. Good food …
Great place for Italian Pizza &amp; Pasta.  The atmosphere is Cody &amp; service is great !
As a gluten intolerant, eating while traveling can be a bit hit and miss. I often get bread rolls that are completely inedible. Cicheti was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the frutti di mare, and the waiter confirmed that gluten free pasta …
Excellent pizza and pasta. Two floors
Wood-fired pizzas and calamari rings were OK, not fabulous, especially considering the price. The dessert--gelato and cake--were good. Nice dining ambience and decent service, but overall expensive for what you get.
Good food. Terrible seating and ordinary service
The Pasta here are priced at $25 - $50+ , and it may sound very expensive. But I must tell you, the Taste to Price ratio is on point! …
The food here is mind blowing! Everything we ordered (Gnocchi, four cheese pizza and the cacao cake) was a burst of flavor. The staff was also kind enough to write happy birthday for our dessert as we were here for a birthday dinner. Cicheti is a must try, I&#39;ll surely be back again and again!
Pizza and pasta... taste really Italian, really good. Yummy 😋 …
Great pizza, good wine, nice atmosphere, service was prompt and organised a great find.
Serves mainly authentic Italian Pizza. Tastes quite good. Portion quite small for the price. Cozy tight atmosphere.

Great pizzas
Everything was great
Very good pizza, possibly the best in Singapore
Held my sister’s bachelorette party there, the service was good, atmosphere was warm and cosy. The food is amazing! It was quite hard to pick a favourite. Flavours were just right and temperature of food too!
Quite packed but food was great. No regrets. Book a table.
Excellent pizza!
Had dinner with my family of 5 today, have heard good things about Cicheti &amp; was looking forward. Unfortunately, the food fell short. We felt that the linguine and crab meat pasta were bland, the bismark pizza was average. The iberico pork …
Solid pizza but not great. The tomato sauce is watery and eats into the dough and anchovies are overly salty
Tried the gnocchi and the Romana pizza, i liked them. The dough was well done for the pizza, only thing is that too little gnocchi on the plate and too much truffle flavor.

Authentic italian cuisine. Order 2 pizzas and 2 pastas. Each dish was amazing, and amongst my group of 4, the opinion was split on which was our most favored dish. …
A popular, buzzy and sleek restaurant, ideal for drinks with friends.  The pizza and tiramisu were outstanding - definite must tries. Rich, punchy …
Gnocchi was excellent. Pizza margherita was sub-par, dough was chewy and nothing stands out with the taste. Table and chairs were a tad small and not as comfortable as we would like for two pax.
Worth every penny. Excellent food, great ambience and service.
We had a 5 course dinner at Cichetti, the starters were absolutely great (recommend the buratina) although the octopus was a bit chewy.  The gnocchi were nice as well and we had spicy chicken as the main, along with brocoli, delicious.  Great atmosphere especially upstairs , would recommend for dinner with friends or colleagues!

Pizza was tasty, but crust too soft for me.
I ask for amaretto and the server say they are using whisky for amaretto sour and I say nope. I pointed Amaretto Disaronno in the menu and show it to him, and we still gotten amaretto sour which is kind of disappointment. Say n point at the …
Loved dinner at Cicheti! I love gnocchi, mushrooms, truffles and ricotta...and when you combine all of them into one dish I am sold. The gnocchi was delicious! Service was nice and other food and drink was great too. There are 3 tables …
Back to Ciceti after a few years. Excellent and super tasty gnocchi and easily one of the best pizzas. Loved this unique carbonara pizza.
nice mood, delicious pizza
They rival my favourite pizza place d.o.c. in a big way. I was very impressed by this light fluffy and beautifully spotted pizza. The flavour of the dough is amazing 👏 …

I went on a Thursday night. The food itself was good, although to me for the price you pay the portions are a bit small. I was seated on the 2nd floor and I found the seatings a bit …
I didnt make reservation but they let me eat by the bar on 2nd floor, the place is full and lively. We ordered three different kind of pizzas, prosciutto rucola, romana and salsiccia, they were delicious especially accompanied by beer.
Food is good. Kids love the pasta. Pizza is a bit off.
5 stars for the Amatriciana! Awesome how they get the bits of guanciale to be crispy little flavour explosions. Octopus was just ok. Maybe better with a bit more seasoning and a bit more char. …
pizza is average but pasta is pretty good☺️
Food was good specially the side and pizza. Reasonable pricing.
Very good food but short of staff.
Great pizza
The home made pasta here are very good! Enjoyed the Mafalde with braised lamb. It was so good.
Delicious food in a quaint setting. The pastas aren&#39;t traditional but very well executed and the pizzas are a delight. Crack pie is great and worth an order.
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore. Good food. Good service. No drama.
The pizza was great and I absolutely love the pizza crust. It’s soft and easy to bite. However there isn’t much variety and I felt the menu is a little too heavy on the carb side.
Visited Cicheti a few mths back on a weekend for dinner. The food was great and service was excellent- we were served by Pardeet. Despite the second level of the restaurant being full and Pardeet seemingly taking on most of the roles for …
Didn’t dine here. Just my personal experience working for grab, was assigned to take an order from here. Took 25 mins for them to ask me about the order, stood there but none of …
Had carbonara pizza, gnocchi n calamari.. was ok but nothing much to rave abt. Dough were too tough n chewy to my expectation.. calamari was Intro by waiter saying it’s the “BEST” calamari he eaten however not too my liking as batter was too thick n dry.. gnocchi was also not something to shout about.
Arrived at around 12:30 on Sat and there is no more seat inside, can only sit outside along the street.  The sit wasn’t ideal, weather was hot, pregnant wife can’t drink anything on the beverage menu and was hungry and frowning.  However, …
Cheese 🧀♥️ …
Fantastic food and even better service! HIGHLY recommend the flatbread, pumpkin and espresso martini! Great vegetarian starter selection in general, perfect wine recommendation and the veg pizza was so good 🤌🏽 …
Nice ambience and pasta was handmade! Pizza was amazing as well. 2 thumbs up for the service!! 👍🏻👍🏻 …
Great food but pasta portion was too small. Nice ambience but pricing is a tad high.
Host treated us with disrespect. Don’t recommend location as their customer service lacks professionalism.
Pizza is amazing. Love the dough
Great pizza and wine! Service was great too. Recommended to reserve early as it&#39;s very popular. Walked in and had to sit outside but managed to shift indoors when they opened up the 2nd storey so all&#39;s good :)
Pizza quite okay though had better than this. One staff was rude.

They messed up on an order, but fixed it very quickly - as soon as it was brought to their attention. Very professional! I was satisfied. BTW, the $40+ pizza comes with big cheese. (See photo.)
literally the best pizza i’ve ever had
best italian restaurant! second time here and it’s still as good as i remembered. best pizza i’ve eaten and i came back for the frutti de mare which is so so good! though the ordering took a bit of time due to miscomm, the service recovery was really good. overall great experience and great food!
Omg, loved this place.  Great service, nice atmosphere, and they didn’t treat me like a leper for dining alone.  The pizza crust was fabulous, as was the honey/chili/salami pizza.  I want to go again!!!!
Star of the meal was the truffle gnocchi that had great flavour and bounce. Salami pizza was also well balanced as the chilli honey was a nice touch to balance the saltiness of the salami. Service staff was attentive and friendly. Would …
Amazing Italian food! I&#39;ve eaten here a couple times and both experiences were excellent. The seasonal asparagus was to die for, their signature/well-known gnocchi dish was phenomenal, and the fig tart was a great finish. I tried the …
Cozy Italian restaurant tucked away on a side street. This place has amazing food and I was impressed with everything I had, especially the potato &amp; pulpo. It was a daily special but hopefully they keep it around for a while!
Nice and cosy Italian restaurant with their own fire oven. Good food and drinks, very attentive staff (even though we had outdoor seats), and will definitely be back again soon!  Reservations recommended!
Best pizza I’ve had in my life. Please order the Sopressata. Unbelievable.

Good food. Service staffs are helpful And polite! Remember to make reservation to avoid disappointment. Indoor seating is a must.
Beware of eating pizzas here. It will be difficult to settle for your neighborhood pizzeria after this. Stunning, tasty and memorable pizzas. Great bunch of starters - we had the …
Amazing food and staff were great. Really enjoyed the calamari, roast pumpkin and the bufala margherita was simply to die for. Will be back asap
Cicheti One of the OGs of Italian bistro dining located in Kampong Glam serving up Italian with a hint of Mediterranean. Popular place that is usually packed. …
Nice and cozy place at the heart of Arab street. Pizza tastes delicious. Pizza dough was very fresh and soft. Surely a nice place to try Pizza paired with traditional Italian wines (If you like Red, Nebbiolo is must try). Staff is really humble and hospitality is very nice.
Vessel sprouts and pizza are definitely worth going back for
Great modern Italian place.
Way too extra salty pizza and equally extra oily gnocchi. Nothing special, do not recommend.
Went there to celebrate my gf birthday. The food was simply one of the best I&#39;ve tasted. Their bread, pasta, pizza and even their tiramisu are mouth watering. Will definitely head back.
Been in Singapore for a year and rate Cicheti’s as the best Italian we have visited .. fantastic food, staff who are passionate about their menu and service .. did I say service? .. yes, in a country that sometimes struggles with delivering …
If they have the asparagus on the daily specials menu when you visit: ORDER IT. Loved the way they plated it, with the sous vide egg hidden from view until you spread the two nice and t h i c c  stalks of perfectly charred asparagus apart with your hands. Much like the first time with my ex.

Long overdue review. Came here for a quick lunch. Had a full carbs meal. But it was well worth it. One of the best pizza’s I had. Very delicious. Gnocchi tasted good, but it was too filling. Wish I had ordered something lighter. Definitely a place I will visit again soon to try out other dishes.
Very nice and polite staff. Great food even for vegeterians. Thanks Harsha for good recommendations.
The best gnocchi we&#39;ve ever tasted! Soft, light, fluffy. Incredible. We also had a daily special Napolitano style pizza, with one of the best crusts I&#39;ve ever had. …
Had a reservation and even placed a deposit but the restaurant was closed when I arrived. There was no notification of the restaurant undergoing maintenance and they even sent a reminder of my reservation 4 days before. Poor restaurant management, do not book this place.
Reserved one month in advance, restaurant confirmed. When I went there on the day of reservation it was closed for renovation. Emailed, called, WhatsApp’d them, no response. Do not trust this place at all.
Delicious food! Enjoyed the Pumpkin anti pasti. Outdoor seating is nice for the atmosphere n street vibes. Celebrated my 30th birthday here. Do book in advance for guaranteed seating as is quite small
Yummy!
Food was below average and took forever to arrive. Went here for my daughter&#39;s 15th birthday dinner. The calamari was soft not crisp, the salad was doused in vinegar and the mushroom pizza was full of salt. …
I&#39;m not a pasta fan, however I enjoyed their Squid Ink Pasta, Fusili Nero. It was very tasty and after the first bite I wanted more! …

Must try with the gnocchi! The pizzas are great too and the dough isn’t dry. Service was good and the ambience was great too. Perfect for dates or catching up in a group.
We’ve been going to Cicheti for years and really love the food. We enjoy all of their dishes and I would absolutely encourage you to give the restaurant a try if you’ve never been there. The meatballs are good. The prawns are good. The …
Cool place. Nice food. Abit expensive. I paid $260
Outstanding food and cozy environment.
Charming Italian eatery with an outdoor option. Gnocchi deserves special mention. Oily yes but too good, the texture and cheese wprk mighty well together. The vongole was beautiful too. Calamari was juicy and well seasoned, battered and …
Had an amazing dinner at Cincheti. Highly recommend the beef capacious (ring of herb makes the beef pop) and the pizza is amazing (Napoleon style pizza)
One of the best Italian gems in Singapore
Simple, unpretentious with good food and good service
Review from a native Italian: I have just been to this place with my family to hear that they only serve one pizza per table… guys seriously.. either you call yourself an Italian restaurant and you MUST serve as many pizzas per table as the …

The best pizza in Singapore
Was here for pizza and pasta. The grilled vegetables salad was really good! But a bit expensive for the portion served. Not a fan of gnocchi but friend wants, still not a fan.
Love their all out customer service here!  Food wise, we were wowed by the cured meat platter and gnocchi… not so on the …
Very cozy authentic Italian restaurant. Great food and service. High in demand so make reservations.
Service is slow, but food is good. Hard to find parking lot.
Great food.
Visited during valentines day, probably wasn&#39;t the best idea
Wonderful cosy Italian restaurant around Arab street.. great pizzas however the pasta could be have been better.
The food was pretty good! But unluckily on the day of our visit there was a table of customers getting too &#34;happy&#34; that even one of the female customer shouted so loud that all other customers in the restaurant became dead silent
Service - Even though we booked and have to put a deposit we still had to wait about 20mins to get seats …
Overpriced for the quality. Ordered Zucchini flower (too oily, batter could be crisper and lighter), pulpo (really tasty! the sauce reminds me of Serbian&#39;s ajvar), gnocchi (good), linguine with clams (mediocre), beef cheek pasta (meh) and a carbonara pizza. Overall, pizza is tastier and pasta is mediocre.
Pizza is excellent! Recommend to order pizza more than pasta. A little expensive for lunch.
Read that the pizza were really good but the one I had ordered was a little burnt. Overall still a very good experience but can be a pricey
Love the food and the ambience, every dishes were just 👌. Easily one of our favourite Italian restaurants in SG. …
Exceptionally impressed with the service of Pardeep. He was not only running up and down the stairs to bring hot dishes of food up to serve patrons, but also down to wash the dirty ones. This is on top of juggling service of taking orders, …
reservation at 8pm but have to wait for our seats until 8.30pm. ordered food but waited very long for it to arrive. 2 tables ordered after us but food came first. when making payment the staff return my card to the wrong table. Felt that …
Good food especially the pulled beef cheek pasta. The Iberico pork was well done as well with the side of tangy salad. …
Had the Gnocchi and Linguine, amazing! Pizza was the best I ever had!
The olive oil bread was yummy and fruity 🥪. I recommend the crab lump pasta)(very bouncy pasta) and the magherita cheese pizza. Although I&#39;d prefer a pizza with more ingredients than tomatoes and cheese. the pizza had &#34;wok hei&#34; 🍕 👍 …
Nice Italian Restaurant with Home made food .
First time at the restaurant and have to say the place is very unprofessionally run. Mantea is to take a deposit, overbook the place and leave your customers in a limbo.
Good food, great service
Wow! What a lovely dinner. We chanced upon this place, and really enjoyed the diaviola pizza and gnocchi. So good! If you&#39;re planning to come do make a reservation so you can get a table. This place seems kind of popular. Also, what also …
Pizza was good. We tried many dishes. Not bad. The waiters speak too fast and mumble to themselves. A bit hard to Hear them as there are no hardcopy menu now.
Great food at reasonable prices. The Octopus starter was incredible! Service was very good and friendly and knowledgeable. The pizza was just ok but all other dishes was great.
Fantastic food and service as always!
Amazing little restaurant for authentic Italian food. Highly recommended.

Great food, fantastic service. Pizzas are delicious. Avoid the seafood stracci though - it tasted exactly like char kway teow
Almost always full. But it’s worth the wait! Pizza is so great 😍 one of the best pizzas I had in SG. …
Love thr food here, definitely will return. Asparagus and Burrata were great! Mussels were extraordinary.
My first experience was flawless… from the food to the service, it was a gastronomic escapade. I was awed! And I&#39;m so sure I will be coming back here again very soon!
Sharing my experience so people can reconsider their decision to visit Cicheti. I took away 1 star for every point encountered. …
I love the food here usually. The pizza cooked in the wood fire oven is outstandingly tasty. Usually very consistent, the last time I came here it was slightly underwhelming. But still good. Perhaps slightly too busy. I&#39;ll return again to …
Great food, great ambience but better music selection will be great.
Amazing customer service by Maia! We celebrated our friend&#39;s birthday and were sitting outdoors yet she was super attentive to our needs. Thank you so much for such a fabulous experience!
Wonderful place on Kandahar street... Go here for the wines (try the Barolo) and the pizzas .. would go again!
Good food, the pizza was lovely.
Best Napoleon style pizza in Singapore. Keep coming back for their pizzas! Service and ambience was impeccable. Pardeep is a superb service staff!
We went to dinner on 7th December 2021 dinner time.  1st impression : Was not greeted with a smile when we told the hostess that we …
Love the pizzas at Cicheti. A (not so) hidden gem in the Arab street precinct. Reservations definitely recommended.
Food was excellent, and service was very attentive and friendly.
Lovely ambience. Salsiccia Pizza was great. Calamari Fritti, Burratina and Gnocchi were alright. Service was attentive too, thank you :)!
Average food, small portions. Between two persons (average eaters), we had a pasta, a pizza and a main, and we still felt hungry after. Service was nothing to shout about. I would much rather head to Bar Cicheti.
Back here for so much needed love. Everything is on point. Trust their recommendations.
Amazing pizza!!!!
Right from the get-go service was a massive letdown. Asked one of the waiter (female Indian lady) for food recommendation and she did not want to entertain us and had to take order from someone else. The other waiters were perfect though! …
Love the food and atmosphere here!
Pizza was nice..we ordered Carbonara pizza..
Great ambience. Food is tasty. Pizza is great and a must try. It’s soft and easy to bite.
Best tiramisu in Singapore
Not worth the price ;(
Food, drinks and service was perfect! Too many amazing options to choose from, we will be back for more. Highly recommended 👌 …
Good flavors in the Nero. But I am thinking it can be a bit more Al dente. Stracci is excellent in both pasta and flavour. Enjoyed the desserts very much though I think the crack pie can be a tad less sweet.
I visited for pick up, two weeks in a row, Nice pizza, it&#39;s good for 1 pc per 1 person.
Great pizza and pastas. Good prices! Their crack pie is to die for and seriously addictive.
I may have found the best pizza. The tiramisu after d …
Hey Cicheti, I really wanted to love you. Your decor is hip and the place has cool grungy vibes. …
Good food and good service! 😁 …
We visited Cicheti on the 8th of October 2021. The service staff was extremely friendly and prompt with seating us. The manager, Sapphire, was attentive and thorough when explaining how they could provide vegan options for my partner. The …
Ordered the napoletana pizza and spaghetti which turned out way too salty for our liking (pass me the water please). While the pasta was a little undercooked, the olives (appetizer) and the chilled bottle of Prosecco made up for it.    The …
Pizzas always a favourite. Love the burratina.
Steep but good
Fantastic food and even better service. The pizzas are some of our favorite in Singapore tho recommend trying out the crab pasta too.
Love the burratina, it’s served with pesto and onion marmalade. I dont eat onion or garlic and yet I finished the entire thing. The orange white wine is interesting, And the gnocchi was delightful. Not the best pasta I had but overall it …
Great food and ambience. The crumble cake/ burrata/ gnocchi were great!
Loved the pizzas that we tried. The Burrata was also creamy and good.
Been here multiple times and the pizzas are always a delight. Rather large in size and the variety is more than sufficient. As a vegetarian I still can find several options in the menu to choose from, but I wish there were more. While there, don&#39;t forget to try the Burratina for starter.
Made a reservation at 8pm on a Friday night and had to wait outside the restaurant for the previous group of customers to leave. It was warm but that&#39;s ok, it was completely understandable. Food was pretty good and came fast—I personally …
Best pizza I had so far in Singapore. Got the Salsiccia and the fennel pork sausage was just so good. The tonnarelli nero pasta dish was cooked perfectly al dente. Portion could have been bigger though. The waiting time was very long, 60min …
Came here on a Saturday for lunch and the service was great - the staffs made sure to check if our food were good, and even took note and ensured that we had fresh plates for the pizza when they noticed that we were about to start on it. …
Service was great, staff was very polite and attentive. Food was not bad but I was expecting much more, pizza was a bit chewy and plain.
The quattro formaggio pizza is to die for and the service provided by Pardeep was spectacular and made the experience so much better.
Fantastic pizza, and fantastic service from Pareep who made our meal an absolute joy! …
Booked a place at cicheti and never regretted it. When in doubt, ask for recommendations because we had no idea what we are looking at. In the end, We had Tonnarelli Nero pasta and the Salsiccia Pizza. …
My partner ordered the lady and the tramp set meal for my birthday takeout since we cant dine in yet. Loved every single dish and was incredibly value for money. They had pasta, gnocci, bread as starters, salad and a walnut cake. All so good! Would love to come back here to dine in soon.
Visited twice in a week, did not disappoint! Even with takeaway, the burratina was on point and amazing. We had the Salciccia pizza which we thought was the better one, as the fennel sausage was simply ooomph, and the pizza dough was destroyed completely. Lovely!
Very good food… especially the pizza
Good food. Slightly slow service
good food quality
Very nice restaurant with wood oven pizza and gorgeous food.
Very nice
Exceptional Italian fare, the food here is so well made that we enjoyed nearly every dish. Definitely not the last time that we will be here ✨
👍🏻 fresh and interesting pasta dishes 👍🏻 pizzas are okay - a little undercooked, maybe 👍🏻 tucked away …
Quaint shop house restaurant. Hearty portions. Good service.
Rustic place with heartwarming dishes! Honestly one of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in a long time. My family and I ordered 2 appetizers, 2 pizzas and 2 pastas to share and it was amazing! We made the smart move to order …
Nice setting. Friendly staff. Nice food
Cozy place where one might often bump into friends who share the same taste haha
Arriving at the door to get takeaway at 20:58. Initially the person at the entrance greets us and says we can still order. He goes inside to speak to a lady with short hair and he comes out saying she said no as it’s 21:01. …
The Sopressara is a big must!!!!!!!!!
This place is great but a couple things holding it back from the 5 stars.  We had the burratina which was amazing. Good flavor and unique twist with the …
Wow! Excellent pizza and pasta. In spite of the EVOO as a condiment, the high quality and flavour of the EVOO was impressive. Easily my favorite go to for a nice meal. …
We’re impressed with every bite and every sip we took at this laid-back Italian restaurant. …
The staff were so lovely! Great atmosphere, great food, the pizza was incredible and the pasta with pulled beef cheeks just absolutely wonderful! Will definitely be back!
Burratina is a must order!!! So good and creamy and tastes super delicious with the caramelized onions and sourdough bread 😘💕 …
Great pizza, crack pie and meatballs dish. Will order again!
One of the best pizza&#39;s in town, totally worth the trip down.
It could be because I used delivery and maybe food is not that fresh anymore, but the pizza is just chewy without much flavours. The pasta also lacks any special flavours, is just pasta. Overall a disappointing experience.
Authentic pizza 🍕 is very delicious. Tomatoes give it a great flavor. The pizza is baked v …
Good quality and delicious Italian food. Cosy and romantic place for dine in.
Pizza is awesome, staff were friendly and attentive and atmosphere is nice and calm away from all the high rises and hustle bustle. …
Based on what so many people had said about Cicheti, I had big expectations of this restaurant.  Everyone had raved about the pizza, in particular.  So my husband and I booked a table for two to celebrate an anniversary. …
Octopus &amp; Prawn Pasta were excellent.
Awesome staff and service! Food is fantastic too!
Epic pizza crust
Delicious pizza (though I prefer the dough from d.o.c. as it is lighter) and nice crack pie. The place is quite small so you must book ahead - the ambience is quite nice.
Great pizza
A nice ambience, good service and great pizza. The pizza has a thick crust which is not crunchy but slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the insides. The pizza is lightly salted. Toppings were just right. …

Really enjoyed the Burrata and Tonnarelli Nero, only downside is that serving for both is not a lot for 3 pax. Though pizza is their best seller, we felt it was just ordinary and too doughy. Will return for the pastas!
Best pizza I&#39;ve had in Singapore by a long shot. I had the Romana and it was absolutely perfect; I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. …

Loved the gnocchi and carbonara pizza with the egg. Pizza with the salami tasted too fishy and salty.  Overall enjoyed the food.
Used to have good food and good service and I recommended it to many friends and it was a regular hangout place for us. …
Not as good as &#34;advertised&#34;, the restaurant has a good reputation but not living up to it. Food is reasonable but nothing great. Wine on the expensive side and service is average. …
A go-to place for amazing pasta. My favourite is the paccheri - it’s good even for delivery! Make reservations in advance!
This is an excellent little (and I MEAN little) restaurant on Kandahar St serving authentic Italian food. The seared toast with burrata (pictured) is divine and the pizzas are first class, with gorgeous leopard spotting on the corniche. …
Come for the lovely and creamy Burratina and stay for the awesome pizza. Service was good.
Great pizza.
Excellent homey no frill pizza and pasta dishes.
Food was good, service as well! Great pizza alongside with pasta! The dessert was good too
Loving the pasta and the pizza. Do rem.to make a reservation esp on weekend
The service is good and food are good especially the pappardelle with lamb
The gnocchi and the roasted  pumpkin appetiser were the highlights for me. The pizza was a little to bready for my liking. The crack pie was a pretty decent way to end our meal. Decor was nice but the choice of music was a little off.
Cool place.  The young ones would love it. Service is normal.  Recommendations of food is so so.  The octopus he recommended weren&#39;t good.  It is only the salty side.  No freshness of the octopus to talk …
I was absolutely blown away by the amazing food and service during my visit there. As per the waiter’s personal recommendation, we got a couple of dishes for sharing. Of note were the following: …
Amazing Italian food and impeccable service. Colleagues and I had a team lunch and ordered a bunch of things to share. Table favourite was the pollo pizza and pappardelle, but everything was delicious and we finished all of it. A bit in the …
Five stars because overall experience was very good. One of the waiters (did not get his name) was wonderful throughout the evening - he was welcoming and so helpful when we asked about the food and drinks menu. Such lovely service seems to …
Pizza was good. We were less impressed by the pasta and antipasti but the overall experience is worth another visit.
The pizza was great, 4 stars. The venue is nice and the service is very fast. The ice water was straight from the tap without ice. The pasta was decent, but average, 3 stars. The reason for only concluding two stars is price. When charging around 33 dollars for a pasta dish I would expect perfection.

Food is great especially the pizza.. Service not bad.. The shop is abit small
Italian restaurant with a cozy and casual. The friendly staff gave me the names of the dishes one by one and explained them.
Loved the pizza crust!! 🍕 …
Had a nice lunch for 2 here and the service was great even though it was peak hour. Only the first floor is open during lunch and the space is quite small. Definitely recommend the Burratina! Pasta and pizza were quite standard but not bad at all. Would definitely take my husband here for a night out next time.
Best napoli style  pizza in Singapore. Pasta is fresh pasta, very nice texture.
Food and location is quite good. Service has room for improvement.
Nice pizza and squid ink pasta
Cozy place with nice pizza n pasta!
This place wins the best italian pizza price in Singapore.
Great pizza!
Had a lovely lunch today with hubby and first daughter. They&#39;ve been teasing me about how good this place is but I&#39;ve never been. So today we decided it was high time I went too. Its in the older quarter of the city so the place is quaint …
Pizza Romana. Tomato sauce overflown and bottom of the pie is soggy af. Gigantic ring as if I ordered seasonless flat bread. Nevertheless my mouth still tastes like ocean thanks to the condensed pot of saltiness-anchovies. …
Just popped in post dinner elsewhere for glass or 2 of Verdicchio my favourite white Italian wine. And some desert lemon tart and steawberry xx. Nice staff in very busy restaurant.
Very good italian
Portions are on the smaller side which its great as we could order more to try. Small restaurant.
Easily one of the best Italian food I’ve had in Singapore.  Tried 2 of their pasta; Paccheri (pulled beef cheek, soffritto) and Gnocchi …
UPDATE 2020: Food is still really amazing esp. the prawns and the margherita pizza. They are well cooked with simple but great combination of ingredients. Price is also on …
Definitely one of the best Italian restaurant to dine in Singapore. The pasta was so so good. Love the pizza as well 🥰🥲 …
Nice ambience and good Italian food. Will visit again.
Good food, however bit disorganized. Waited +20min beyond reserved time. Pizza and food quality is excellent!
Good food, nice ambience &amp; the service was good 👍🏼 visited twice - consistent food quality &amp; service. …
Wine prices were generally affordable. Wine suggested to us was excellent. Pasta was really next level. Great place to wow your date, or yourself.
Calamari was pretty good. But had to wait over 40mins for the mains which came out a little cold as well. Service was dismal... don’t think it’s worth coming again
Cold pizza. Staff didn’t care or give a new hot pizza. Shame because the pizza would have been delicious if it was actually warm.
Food was great, too heavy on the carb side. The restaurant is cozy with nice ambience. The tables are way too close to each other and that night we went it was pretty noisy. The staff was helpful but I guess too comfortable cus he was …
Love their pizza and pasta. Really good food here.
Favourite dish of the night (agreed by the 4 of us): Formaggi Quattro. Favourite dessert of the night : Venezuela 60% Cocoa Cake …
Really authentic italian pizza with nice ambience!
I should have walked away after reading in the menu they had a &#34;chicken pizza&#34;, but it was booked by someone else and it was a rainy day. I ended up ordering a&#34;diavola&#34; that arrived with shredded, rather than sliced, …
Prosciutto E Rucola Pizza is the highlight of my visit here. Pizza dough is one of the best I’ve ever had. It complements the ingredients so well - parma ham, fior di latte, arugula and shaved parmesan. …
Finally managed to visit this restaurant after many attempts and so glad I did. For me the best pizza in Singapore. Hands down. Not the skinny crispy bottom some trendy places have. Or overloaded toppings. Just a great pizza with a nice crust that you can actually taste. And great service. Will be back many times.

Quaint Italian restaurant in Kampong Glam. The complimentary bread was really good, with spicy balsamic vinegar and oil. Had the special starter, grilled octopus ($38) which came a bit overdone. The buffalo mozzarella Margherita pizza had …

Very friendly service staff who slowly explained the items in the menu and were just awesomely attentive. The food was good and at the same time the chef had his own take on all the usual items like tiramisu which came with the alcohol ice blended on top. Will be back to try their other stuffs!
Great food, amazing quality and authenticity. Staff were very friendly and attentive
Lunch experience / superb!!!!
Love the food and service is fab as well.. Polite staff.
Love how the burrata is paired with caramelised onions and pesto. A refreshing change from the usual parma/melon pairing. Unpretentious food. They take great pride in their pizzas, and included a detailed reheating guide to help the pizza …
Implicable service and awesome food. The octupus and mussels are to die for. Pizza was huge and worth every penny. Definitely will be revisiting again sometime soon.
We ordered champagne with two pizzas diavola and  salsiccia , both were a delight to eat. The base was light like it was melting in hand. Great italian restaurant.
Excellent burrata.
Great atmosphere and service, food was delicious. Loved the prawn pasta, burrata, and tiramisu. Would definitely come back again.
Try their carbonara pizza!
I wrote an email in private to feedback but got no replies for the past 2 weeks so I reckon I’ll share my experience here. …
Cute gem for dinner! Pizza base was light and crisp, and enjoyed the TONNARELLI NERO a lot. Prices are quite reasonable, will return!
Nice quiet place for dinner. Had the chopped salad, pizza and clam pasta and ended with the chocolate lava cake. …
Food was good. Had a pleasant birthday celebration. We dropped our cake which was really sad 😢, wish the staff initiated something but it&#39;s okay! 😊 @sabrinabizarre …
The pizza is just AMAZING. Thin, light and crispy crust, with very generous amount of toppings, at a very reasonable price. They serve it piping hot from their monstrous oven. The seafood stew was also very good. Going to be one of our new favourite spots for sure.
Always enjoyed a nice meal here... everything is good - from ambience, service and most importantly the food! Prior booking is necessary especially on a weekend... 👍 …
one of the best homemade pastas in singapore but portions were tad small, even our server said he could eat 2-3 pastas in a seating. service was ad spotting as wait staff was a bit thin and you could see manager rushing back and forth to &#39;put out fires.&#39;
“Loved the burratina- cheese starter”  The pizza was pretty good too but the cheese starter was the best for me 😅. …
Top notch food, pizzas are to die for
Food was very good
Great pizzas
One of the top three pizzas in Singapore, highly recommended!
Great food and ambience!
Love everything tonight, over my expectations.
This place.. is  best Italian restaurant in SG.. Hard to book in here. Always fully booked. Definitely go there again!
Amazing. Every single thing that we ordered was good. The pizza was the highlight, but sadly  didn&#39;t take picture! Go check it out
Buratina, octopus and Parma ham pizza were all delicious, relaxing atmosphere!
Good food, loved the burratina. Will go back again. Slightly pricey though
Beautiful pizzas, it&#39;s really disappointing that the wines are so expensive compare to other restaurants (like 30%)
Delicious pizza and roasted pumpkin. A little pricey ($20-26 for the pizza, $15 for the starter which is small), but very good quality - worth it!
Nice set delivered to your home!! Good pizza
Best pizza in Singapore!  Really, really good.  Oddly, the pastas are not up to snuff.  Excellent salads and addictive crack pie.  Cute location too, although the prices are a little dear.
Must try their Pesto Burrata with caramelised onion! And Italian pizza!
pizza was good but service was bad
Delicious Italian authentic restaurant!
Awesome pizza, right out of the pizza oven to your table. Authentic and yummy. Also good value for money
Read about this place online and wanted to try out myself. The dough does reminded me the pizza in Italy and taste was good! Service was alright, didn&#39;t see the friendly side that the reviewers mentioned. …
First of all, food is good. I would have given this 5 stars if not for 3 things: 1) Reservation - The person handling the reservation was a very poor …
Nice food but very small and congested. .. they have placed too many tables and chairs....feels like hong Kong when I ate here....
Spaghetti was nothing special, very spicy
Nice place, excellent food, pizza is one of the best in Singapore. Cost for dinner consistent with expectation. I appreciate the kindness of staff.
Hands down the best Italian place in SG! Authentic Italian food at a cozy quiet corner of Bugis (: Highly recommend their braised lamb sugo &amp; porcine parpadelle. The carbonara pizza was a slight miss for me, but the octupus (special for the day) and polite staff made up for the overall experience 😚 …
Ordered the gnocchi with mushroom, and I liked the way the gnocchi was cooked! I am not really a fan of mushroom but I ate most of them down anyway! The sauce wasn’t too overpowering so I enjoyed the meal! …
Please try to make a reservation before coming to avoid disappointment... Very good tasting Italian food.. Burratina is a MUST to order for Antipasta!!
They make best pizzas in Singapore. Crack cake is a must try dessert item.
Great pizza and appetizers. Can be busy during weekends.
Legit Diavolo pizza and beef cheek pasta. Actually everything we ate here was delicious. Service was great too and so was the ambience. I’d definitely come back here again!!
Our new favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. The staff was very friendly, the food was great, and the restaurant with the see-through kitchen was very inviting. Will definitely be back.
Good Italian if you are in Arab st area
Excellent Italian food in Singapore
Excellent Italian food in Singapore
Real pizza
4 for the food and 5 for the music and chill vibes
Far too overpriced for the low quality food they provide. The dishes I ordered were too salty. A basic spaghetti took ages from them to prepare and the quantity was too little yet very salty. Awfully appalling customer service from the …
Very nice restaurant , atmosphere good and the food was delicious. Don’t miss the Boratina 😋 Highly recommended . …
Good food and service. Just at tad noisy
As Italian I was skeptical about pizza but I changed my mind
I was there for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner. Didn&#39;t know this place existed until a friend of mine introduce. The food were simply amazing, the staffs are mostly friendly, the toilet is clean &amp; the design (upper floor) is very artsy fatsy. This is now my new favourite Italian restaurant!
Totally bad service and incredibly bad acoustics in the room. Bartenders and waiters too snobbish and no one had time for new customers. We will not come here again. We didn&#39;t even get to order food after half an hour at the table. Stay a …
Very good, quality pizza and impeccable service
Best pasta and pizzas in town.. Appertizers never fail to disappoint either.
Just delicious! On top of my list for italian food in Simhapore. But hard to get a sit if not booked...
Good food but long time to wait for food
The food here is consistently good. I particularly love the Asparago - which is grilled asparagus with breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. It&#39;s SO incredibly tasty. The pizzas here are great, the Margarita De Bufala is dreamy, love the tomato …
Great atmosphere and food was excellent. Definitely recommend and will return again
Most Favorite Pizza in SG.Nice ingredients.
The impressive decor does not make up for the service falling short. The food tastes good, served with imagination and yet 2 stars ? The service is indeed that much of a drag.....not a pleasant experience. The manager did try her best to salvage a situation where an order for pizza unnecessarily went wrong.
Love the place
Love the place
Very slow service on main course.. the pizza took forever to come, more than 40 mins. When we asked why other table got their pizza before us, when they came much later than us, the reply was that they put orders of pizza at same time!  The other place at keong saik is much better..
Enjoyed our dinner here - we were a group of nine and everyone got pasta but for one. My skis ink tagilatelle was just ok, but the lamb ragu with home made paperdelle was delicious. Everyone sent they plates back empty - which is always a good sign!
One of the best Italian restaurants in town and THE BEST pizza. Love this place. The Riso dessert is also killer. The team are all very warm and professional. Well done. Keep it up!
Food is good.. Service was OK only.. And it&#39;s too noisy
Nice Cosy place to have Italian food. Staff &amp; service was great. Taste wise food is good, but i am sure can be improved. Portions were good for all the dishes. Loved their wine selection. Price wise, found this place on a higher side. buon appetito !!!🙂🙂 …
Nice pizza and an interesting, not so expensive wine list.
Good wood-fired pizzas and decent pasta let down by disinterested and inattentive lunch service.
One of the favourite Italians in Singapore
Perfect for chill diner in small group
This is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore that I have ever been to. Nothing can go wrong here.
I do love the food ..
Great pizza... book ahead...
Great food and great service.
Good food will definitely go back
Portion could be better for the price. Overall the food is great, full of flavour. We have a good wine too. I have yet to try the other dishes. Will try to go back.
Super disappointing experience despite good reviews.  Service: Horrible. Lady by the name of Eve did not even manage a smile to my …
Good Italian food.
Very good pizza and ambience
Went to this place after my friend recommended it and absolutely loved it. I am a really big fan of Italian food and I think this place serves the best I have had in a long time. For starters we ordered burrata, carpaccio and prawns, they …

Very tasty gnocchi and napolese style pizza.
Great pizzas and great desserts!
Great pizzas and great desserts!
Food quality is good, selection is decent, price is reasonable, location is interesting (a stone’s throw from Arab Streets), but service is lacking. Cold and inattentive. My water glass was empty for almost half an hour and no one attended …
Nice atmosphere. Food was flavorful, but small portions for the price. Asparagus were delicious
Food is ok but the service was so catastrophic that it ruined our evening. Needs some serious improvement but not worth trying again.
Mains were better than dessert. We liked the tagliatelle and the uni pasta. Good portions and well-seasoned. The octopus also had good flavour but was a tad chewy. The rice pudding dessert needs more work. It didn&#39;t quite go with the …
Good food
Good authentic Italian pizza
Conducive environment, great service and good food
Way too salty. Flat bread was salty, so was pizza and pasta :(
Appetizers are excellent. Wine is great, pasta not to my liking but definitely decent. The pizzas other tables ordered looks delicious. Weekday dinner, was full house.
Service and food is average. Better value for the dollar at other Italian restaurants.
One of the few places you can find crack pie in Singapore. Pastas are good, and pizzas are proper Neapolitan.
Very good food. Pizza was nice but the dough should have been cooked a little more
Food was great. Don&#39;t miss the octopus or lamb dishes. Sangria was delectable.
Decent selection of food. This place is great for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. Ambience is really nice and clean.
Good italian restaurant 😋🍻 …
Great selection of Italian small plates and pasta.
Nice Pizza. Great location.
Good food but overpriced
Good food
Best napolitan pizza in singapore
Food is generally good and service is decent. There’s sitting on the 2nd floor if the first floor gets a bit noisy. They make their pasta right in front of you so it taste much better than what you usually get elsewhere. …
My paccheri pasta was a little undercooked but the ragout was delicious.
Pizza was probably the best I&#39;ve had in Singapore! The ambiance is really nice. Highly recommend!
Great italian cuisines!
Probably my favorite pizza place in Singapore. Any pizza with the red sauce will be a slam dunk! I also love their take on burratina, where they add caramelized onions and it works. They have a nice selection of French wine. Highly recommended.
Yummy pizza ! Loved it, my favorite pizza place in SG and I tried quite a few..
Limited seatings, but good service, tasty food and the alley is not too crowded or noisy even if you have the outdoor seats. My wife and I had a good time.
Brilliant.
Best Italian in town. That is it...
Poor reservation management. Don&#39;t bother - better chose the well known alternatives in Robertson Quay
I used to be a regular as it used to be awesome. Sadly they failed a few times in a row and management seems to give a ****. Better check out other places...
Lovely place for a special occasion. you can catch the sunset at the roof top. We enjoyed the pizza and chocolate cake. Grilled octopus was a little overcooked. Pork was decent but for that price tag, we were a little underwhelmed.
An Italian gem in Singapore! Enjoy!
Quite authentic Italian food. Simply Iove their pizzas!

Price to quality ratio needs improvement. Far from original italian food. Nice location and decor. The pizza was the better of the choices although they had a lot of water in its sauce. Personally, i won&#39;t go back.
One of the best italian pizza in Singapore ! Their wines selection is really nice and the people are the sweetest !
Awesome really but it takes a long time for the order to come to the table so take note of it.
Great Italian place. The pizza is great!
This restaurant doesnt even deserve a star.  Was greeted by a manager standing at the door. My family and I had already …

Authentic Italian dishes pizza one of the best in SG!!!!
Summary: disappointing, uninspiring. Not a worth visit. Far better Italian restaurants out there with superior quality of food and service …
After trying bar cicheti had to try there place in Arab st as well. The food was excellent and service as well. Everything we tried was amazing. One of the best Italians in Singapore. Will definitely come back. Highly recommended
A vongole to die for. One of the most succulent clams I&#39;ve had with perfectly cooked pasta/ Seriously if you don&#39;t eat the vongole, I will judge you.
Good pizza and good atmosphere. A little expensive for the size o …
Good pizza, fresh products. A little small for the price.
One of those nice Italian restaurants that we had in Singapore.  We went there without a reservation, but we are straight forward with our …
I love this spot. One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore. Affordable, casual and consistently good from starter to dessert — although I’m a little heartbroken that they took my favorite ravioli dish off the appetiser list!
Been wanting to come here for pizza! Finally! The pizza was total comfort food. Exactly what I needed to munch on. Will be back!
Quite a lovely place for Italian. We did a 22 people wine dinner party on the 2nd floor and service was OK apart from the flow of food which wasn&#39;t as smooth as it should be. Food was delicious and the decor was nice. Shall revisit
Good but unjustifiably overpriced. Us a reference, you can get a meal on top of MarinaBay for almost the same price. Pizza was ok though and stuff was very helpful and pleasant.

Had dinner here to celebrate my sister’s birthday. Turned out to be a very bad experience for us and we left feeling very upset, including the birthday girl. …
Was attracted to this restaurant because of the cosy ambience and decor (from outside). Made reservations for dinner on a Thursday for birthday.  Good Italian food, but slightly overpriced for what you get. The “cosy” experience was spoiled …
One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Not extremely affordable but worth the price. The burrata was especially good!
The shop floor was rather small but staff were attentive. However the food was over-rated in my opinion. The food also took a really long to come. …
Great Italian food in an intimate setting. Good for small groups
Very cozy little restaurant with wonderful italian food. Service is friendly and prompt!
Great nice cosy place. Food was great but reservation is a must as its always packed out.
Great little Italian restaurant in Kampong Glam. Wine selection is decent but the burratta and pappardelle are really good and highly recommended. Try and snag a seat outside if you can. This is a great date night spot.
Everything about this place is amazing even the toilet deco. Will be back again!
Great ambience and service! The four cheese pizza (have it with Greek honey) is really amazing. And I don&#39;t even like gorgonzola cheese. Would definitely return. It&#39;s a tiny bit hard to find, but it&#39;s near Maison Ikkouku.
Great pizzas!
Love this restaurant. It&#39;s one of my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. The atmosphere and decor is lovely. The pizza tastes amazing and the service is great. Highly recommended.
I personally like the pizzas here. Been here a few times and the food quality continues to be good.
A very small quaint place with really nice pasta. Both indoor and outdoor sitting is available.
If you want to eat a perfect pizza, this is the place for you. The food is simply to die for. It is a bit expensive but definitely worth it
One of the best, authentic Italian Napolitan style pizzas; and yet doesn&#39;t break the wallet. Delicious pastas and delectable staters good enough for those looking for variety other than the pizzas

Dirty place! Average pizza
Decor is good.  Staff is good.  Food is so so
Good food but too small portion imo
Great food, exceptional service.  Will return.
Liked the food...  But the service got bad when it&#39;s near closing time
The pasta with calms and chives was really yummy!
Great italian food. You will get a large variety especially for meat lovers and seafood lovers. Try their octopus
We were actually at the newly-opened Bar Cicheti! It&#39;s a lovely, lovely place. The ambience was cosy and the staff were ever so attentive. We had a really good time there and the food was goooood. …
Disastrous place Extremely bad service Wanted to eat here but turned off by the unreasonable service. …
Great pizza and pasta and of you sit out the back you get a great view of the mosque.
Even though the pici felt more like spaghetti to me, I&#39;ve gotta say it was the best pasta I&#39;ve had in Singapore, ever. The texture of the pasta was perfect and paired beautifully with the ragu. …
Very nice Italian restaurant in Malay village.. the opening hour is short though.. good Italian food.
There&#39;s few dishes that were customized just for the birthday girl. The special appetizer for that night were Spinach Cauliflower Tortellini with Burnt butter sauce, Polpo w fragola with Spanish grilled octopus tentacles. We had their …
One of the best Italian pizzas in Singapore. Their pizza is on the thin side but the crust soft and lovely with great amazingly fresh ingredients!
Very good food.  Will come back again. 9/10
The pizza is seriously amazing, one of the best I ever had anywhere in the world. The pasta didn’t fully live up to those expectations. Cool place!
Pizza was acceptable. Nothing special about the other dishes.
Great Italian joint. Excellent pizzas and salads. Highly recommend the quinoa salad and the chocolate lava cake with salted caramel ice cream.
This Italian restaurant is located a short distance from Arab Street. There was a stone ov …
Price is higher than average but is tasty.
Burratina is a must order. The caramelized onions go veery well with the cheese. Pizzas are good too but it&#39;s a bit pricy overall.
Pasta taste good, love the pizza crust too.
Underwhelming experience.  We had the Nero pasta and capellini which were not fantastic in any way. There&#39;s …
Nice food.
I walked into this place for dinner on Saturday. The host claimed that the restaurant would be busy and that we could only be seated at a bar table upstairs. …
Great menu and service to boot!  Pizzas are some of best in SIngapore.
The pizza is very very good ( I am Italian ) but guys keep this place open longer!
The pasta here was really nice. High quality food here
Great food and service some of the best food in town.
Great place for Italian cuisine. Reasonable price. 🍕 is good! …
Today&#39;s special was the Iberico nuclear zone flavor. The  …
Good Italian restaurant near Arab street. Sit on the first floor if you would like to see the actions and the pizza over. It is more romantic downstair. The pizza is good with crapy crust and freshly made dough. We didnt really tried the …
Nice welcoming, comfertable decor and lighting, impeccable service, professional staff, amazing pizza. Very delicious pizza’s specially the quattro formaggi (with tomato sauce). Definitely if im back in Singapore will return. I just felt the restaurant place is quite weird and does not belong in the Arab area.
Very nice.  Appreciated the view of the pizza oven.  Fairly good service.  Worth making a trip though parking may be challenging.
Really lovely food and good service. Best Italian we&#39;ve found to date.
Great simple Italian food with a buzzy vibe! The pizzas, meatballs and Tonnareli Nero are my favourite. Make sure you get a reservation.
The best food and atmosphere!
Good food, lively atmosphere coupled with warm lighting and cosy colonial shophouse setting. Service is tip top friendly with good sense of humor from the assistant manager. Was there for the wagyu, not disappointed. …
There&#39;s no questioning that Cicheti has the best pizza in town. But also an amazing space and excellent service.
Good Italian food
Service: so so  Food:  average …
Really good food. Must try the starters. Need reservations.
Good price quality place for an Italian food
The food tastes great and the atmosphere is good. The interior was also disappointing. We recommend having an early dinner and taking a commemorative photo with  …
Excellent food, and very hard to get tables because the place is so small. I recommend calling ahead or go much later at night. The 4 cheese pizza is to die for!
Dessert was good, chocolate lava cake. Pizza was not bad, but expected more from Italian flour and fire oven pizza. The fish was soft and tasty but a bit small for 49++. Our pasta , sauce was …

Above average Italian. The service is good but they ran out of Tiramisu both times I was there so if I go again, I would order it In advance.
great ambiance, good and wine. although the wine selection is very limited
Pizza deserves ...
Food is ok, not very fantastically yummy, spaces are tight. Went during lunch.
Consistent quality. I think their pizzas are the best. It doesn&#39;t seat a lot of people so it&#39;s a cosy joint.
The best pizza of Singapore. Consistently.  Small venue, too bad they are closed on Sunday...
Good food bit too expensive
Wood fire pizza
Unfortunately inconsistent when it comes to taste and quality. Returned ordering the exact same dish among other things. Unlike the first time, the octopus wasn&#39;t as fresh or flavorful and the suckers didnt have slighty crispy bite like the …
Great food not too overpriced
Great food n service
Great food!!!
Great food, friendly staff
Pastas are decent, pizza not great, specials like octopus are great! A bit pricey
Serve very good pasta and chocolate lava cake
Sadly another restaurant that takes advantage of success to price gauge its customers and increase prices for the same quality food. It harms goodwill and affects loyalty and lets competitors come in. It&#39;s not about affordability but about principle. I shall go elsewhere from now on
Cute little Italian place. Casual and chic
The dessert is very nice
Burratina so heavenly it brought me to tears
Love the food.  Great hospitality and service. Will visit again
Very disappointing pizza. Service aweful.
Excellent service from the maitre&#39;d! We ordered a medium rare steak which came quite well done. He replaced it for us immediately and offered us a glass of house red and white, as well as the flatbread appetiser. We ordered the roasted …
My friend had been raving about the desserts at Cicheti and we finally planned a girl&#39;s night out to celebrate a birthday here.  It was a great way to celebrate a special occasion. They gave us a table upstairs where we enjoyed the cosy …
Very good food and keeps the quality. The chocolate lava cake is simply awesome
i love the food here. superb.
Lovely place with great pizza!!! Better book in advance.
I heard so much great things about this restaurant so maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe the pizzas is not what they are known for, but I was a bit disappointed.
Probably one of the best pizzas in Singapore
Great food and ambience
Brilliant service, wonderful fresh pasta with fresh ingredients. Be sure to try their squid ink tagliatelle, and their saffron scallop pasta! A must go for all fans of Italian food.

Favourite homestyle Italian. Great atmosphere
Nice food albeit salty
Singapore has lots of Italian restaurants... very few good ones. I have to say Cicheti is one of the best I&#39;ve tried. I had the margherita pizza and I&#39;m looking forward to coming back for more dishes!
Poor Service. Ordered through Uber and never came. Ended up waiting more than an hour only to find out that the order got cancelled. Will not order again. No recovery done from restaurant or Uber.
Very good pizza
Food is amazing! Must go Italian restaurant in Singapore.
This is my local italian and I&#39;ve been here many times over 3 years. Have never been disappointed. Tend to go for the pasta, pulpo, main dishes and desserts. Pizzas are good but I doont generally eat pizza if i f=go to an italian …
Best Italian so far I have tried in Singapore. Great pizza, amazing olive oil based pasta. Great for family or friends gatherings. Of course for couples too. Highly recommended!
It was average
Love the gnocchi
Best pizza in Singapore. Hands down.
You can enjoy Italian food in a cute Perana …
One of the top pizza places in Singapore.
Amazing food. Kinda rushed/verging on rude service, which is fine if the place is crowded, but it really wasn&#39;t when we were there. The food was so good I&#39;d probably go back and endure that again, though, so...
I&#39;ve been here several times and the food is consistently great!
Ok food, but overpriced. Do not under any circstance buy the tomato salad though, ≈S$14 for 10 minitomatoes is not a good price.
Perfect place ! Best pizzas in Singapore and great service
Great everything. Book before you come.
Friendly staff. And excellent food.
Quality,  service,  price.
as an italian, i have to say that cicheti is an awesome italian restaurant, try it! greetings from milan, italy
Excellent quality and service but too expensive for what it is.
Great, fresh, flavoursome, rustic Italian dishes. At the mid price range because of the fresh imported (I assume) ingredients like tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella. Meal for 4 with no drinks or puddings came to approximately $200. …
Great Pizza n food .. Good environment too
Cicheti used to be an old favorite of mine. Cozy- good ambience. good food. But not with their recent expansion and unfriendly staff, I will not be returning. …
Was disappointed with the quality of food here. Could have been better...
One of the best italian restaurants available in Singapore The quality of ingredients used brings out true Italian authenticity Desserts are to die for!
Appetizers were amazing. Pizzas were pretty good too
Great pizza and pasta, affordable tol. I&#39;d recommend booking a table in advance.
Authentic Italian place with great service. The food is really good, don&#39;t miss the chocolate fondant they offer with 72% cacao, it s a killer!
Pizzas, pastas, starters - everything we&#39;ve had has been good. The Cicheti Burratina is fantastic, and love the Insalata di Rucola e Pera.
Wonderful meal with my work colleagues. Service was good
Very good food! Pizza and seafood stew was awesome.
Our go to place for the most delicious pizza in Singapore. The cheese is delightful, and the carbonara pizza (with runny egg on top) is a must try!
Good and fresh pizzas and food served. Service is not too bad. As there was a large group of us so we had some set menu which served a huge range of food which was really fantastic.
You could wander by this place without even noticing is was a restaurant, let alone a really good Italian restaurant.  But it&#39;s worth taking an extra minute or two to track this place down.  The food is excellent.  Quality of the …
Charming location, great friendly service and my pizza and salad were both tasty (didn&#39;t get to try other dishes). Said pizza is of the think crust type however (I personally prefer something more substantial, but to each his own). Pricing was reasonable.
Nice italian food, reasonable price!
Amazing italian foods! Reservation needed!
Great place
Great place ruined by the service level. In fact, it was the GM, Ravi who ruined it for us. It was a great night until he tried to &#34;chase&#34; us away by accusing us of drinking too slow; 2mins before his staff told us it&#39;s ok, we can take our …

Hidden gem. Amazing burrata, oven roasted asparagus, and pizza diavola. The service was fantastic
Great casual Italian.
Great neapolitan style pizza.
i&#39;ve been there 2 days ago... service and food were amazing staff kept looking us and seeing what we need and pour water i even never asked …
Excellent quality food reasonably good service great location fair prices and good choice of drinks
We been there a few times and always the food is delicious and the service is amazing. The wood fired pizza made in real neapolitan oven is just amazing, one of the best I had (I&#39;m Italian so I know really good pizza).
Their Cioppino is a must try!!
Great Amarone!
Wood fired pizza and good pasta too. Nice place to eat with friends and chat all evening.
jus for food n coffee, not a place to hang out .
Burpple menu - tried the chilli crab pasta, sakura ebi pasta and 2x iced lemon tea. Chilli crab pasta was good and flavourful with chunks of soft shell crab. Sakura ebi pasta in comparison is quite bland. Good ambience in a cafe setting. The portion of loaded nacho fries was quite large and good for sharing.
Ordered chilli crab pasta - too salty. Didn’t enjoy the taste. Service was tops though! Applause!
Lovely cafe. You&#39;d like it if you are a cyclist. There&#39;s a workshop if you need.  Had a pulled pork sandwich with chai latte.  Good food. Good ambience. Family friendly.
Food is pretty average for its price. A good place to chill and hide from the city hustle.
Love the &#34;rough&#34; cosy feel of the place..spacious, large tables. Food was good too.
Awesome fish and chips, milkshake and crabmeat crossiant! Had Egg Benedict and didn&#39;t want the ham and they allowed to change to mushroom without an extra charge. Great ambience and friendly staff 😊 breakfast and lunch sets available too.
The food is delicious and the service quality is good. The restaurant maintains a good space between each table. I will come back again.
They serve delicious pulled pork sandwiches during brunch! It comes with amazing potato wedges too 😋  Walked in @1030 on a Sat, was able to get 2 seats at the communal table.  I’m looking forward to return and taste more of the dishes on the menu.
Place was a bit difficult to find. It’s located in a bike themed warehouse and ambience was great. We went for brunch and food was only average. Wish the truffle fries were skinny instead of chunky
A fun cafe with a good atmosphere. Food is standard, nothing different but nothing wrong.
Had a pretty bad experience here where the waiters were rude I can still remember the incident from the beginning of the year in January and thus decided to post this review. Food was not great and overpriced imo
Hidden gem in balestier area! So much feels like in the middle of george town.
Having team Xmas lunch. Food quality is good and portion is big.
Great brunch location. Staff were friendly and attentive to your needs.
Decent food and drinks. Quiet and not crowded on weekdays
Been here several times and the food is ok. But today’s experience has been rather upsetting. The whole place has less than 5 tables occupied and we are shown to communal tables right next to entrance despite 5 small tables available. We …
I didn&#39;t eat here, but the coffee I had was very good and their service is excellent and welcoming.
Worth the journey whether you&#39;re cycling, walking, or just using the bus. The building is a huge warehouse with vaunted ceilings and remains open and spacious inside. The bicycle theme runs deep in the design but it&#39;s not to the point being …
The decor is 10/10 cool, food is tasty
Nice and quiet atmosphere, Good to have lunch there.
Nice place and good food Plus friendly service we come back
Standards at this place have dropped quite a bit. The coffee isn’t up to scratch anymore either. …
Went past 3pm and had to select mains from dinner menu. Fish &amp; Chips was ok (chips were unusually soggy), chicken waffles underwhelming, crab pasta disappointing. Coffee was great though. …
Good ambience for catching with friends. Food wise we had ordered starter, main and desert. Cauliflower in beer batter is crispy and tasty. …
Very nice ambience. Saturday lunch time and it was not very crowded. The &#34;brekkie for 2&#34; was ok. The &#34;roasted chicken and waffles&#34; were good. The chicken was very tender and succulent and the waffles, while a little soggy, were quite good. …
We had an impromptu dinner at wheeler yard as we were shopping for lighting. As expected the exterior and interior were pretty cool for someone whos a biker and loves vintage stuff this place hits the spot. …
Foods ok but it&#39;s a terrible bike shop. Not sure how it even qualified
Best place hispter vibes ever, my wife loves it here and the ambience is good as well! love the fish and chips
Nice place for Casual dinner 😁  1. Chilli Crab pasta, must try 😋 👍🏻 …
Missed the bistro opening hours but the place looks and feels v good to both have a meal and drinks!! Will come back ..
The food is good, but it is a very odd menu. Not really Singaporean. Not really American. Not really anything in particular. I guess you might call it a fusion menu, but it struggles to really find an identity. Service tends to be a little …
No crowds for a weekday post-lunch coffee fix.
Cosy and comfortable setting
Great ambience and food but too far away from bus stops. You have to walk in via kim Keat. …
Retro feel workshop-like entrance with lots of space to secure your bikes. The Wheeler&#39;s Yard bike themed restaurant itself is clean, spacious and air-conditioned. Very friendly staff with good service and food. Great for small to large group gatherings. Good service, good food and nice ambience comes with a price.
Great ambience……. But terrible food. They are really just selling the vibes.
A little pricey, but given the ambience it is pretty worth it. Very spacious and quiet. The cauliflower is surprisingly good.
Good and quiet environment on a Sunday late morning/early afternoon  Friendly staff and food portion was good
Not sure what is the fave here… the food is below average and the staff are hustling… would not come again
The Parmesan Crusted Salmon is flavorful with strong Pumpkin and goji taste. The matcha Latte is a little bit sweet and the tropical dream is refreshing and could add flavor to the ice water provided. I find that the wall and the flooring can be improve.
Nice comfy space. Good for events. Can get crowded on weekends
The portion size was surprisingly large and the ambience was good. Only gripe is that there was no private seating for groups &lt; 4 people, we had to sit at the communal table, which was alright!
Worst breakfast and overpriced. Would’ve put 0 stars if I could. Ordered the brekkie for 2. Bacon was so greasy and so leathery, I could’ve used it as a bicycle saddle.
Quiet, clean ambience. Good service and menu. Love it as it was celebrating my Birthday
Very cozy place for lunch. Not too crowded today. Food taste great and dessert is really yummy!
Sunday, 19/07/2022: Brunch @wheelersyard. Food was OK but not great, coffee was OK, prices were high. No need for repeat visit. Place is of course very IG worthy.
An iconic place for cyclists to hang out with great food.
Lovely place inside the cafe. Variety of food and drinks to choose from. Better have a reservation at the peak hour.

Location is not the most accessible unless you stay around Whampoa/Balestier. There is a time limit for dining in (60 minutes for 3 pax &amp; below) which is odd considering the cafe still had plenty empty seats when I visited on a weekend at …
A bike-themed cafe in a bike warehouse with chill ambience and delicious food. The buttermilk waffles were super delicious, especially when combined with the fruits and ice creams. They were thin, soft yet crispy! The chicken bites were also not bad. I love how crispy and tender they were. Would definitely return!
A bit disappointed with the food except for the dessert. We went for the roasted chicken and bbq pork ribs and i felt collin’s is better. The place looks very nice tho :)
the fish and chip is good: fish is fresh and chip is unique 😁. I had the salmon which was superb. …
Always loved the ambience &amp; food here @ Wheeler&#39;s Yard... Beautiful vintage bicycles &amp; awesome service always make my day when i come here!
Food was cold, bacon was cold and tough as if a jerky. Poached eggs came in a tray bathed in water that was used to poach it, yuck… Coffee was bland and not robust. Sorry but can’t recommend.
it was okay. Ambience wasn’t bad and place was insta worthy. Food wasn’t the best but still ok, but service was… meh. Staff were so anxious for us to leave and to clear our table, but the cafe wasn’t crowded and we were only there for an …
Coffee is good. Food not so much.
Interesting place which I would not know unless my  cyclists friends invited me. The location is in quite place inside baluster and look like a warehouse from outside.. but .. stepping inside, the restaurant is pretty cozy with simple choice of western food .
First time visiting. Dropped by at about 7+pm and the place was very quiet. Service staff were very polite and helpful and informed us of last order/closing of register (about 8+pm) very nicely! …
Best spot for bikers
I ordered the iced expresso and the nacho fries. The fries portion is big, loved the nacho sauce but I didn&#39;t really enjoy the meat. It is an acceptable taste and combination, just do not have the kick that I will order again. Maybe, I …
Interesting decor and good service. The chilli crab pasta is recommended. Portions are decent and price is reasonable.
Great food though portions a little small for the price.

I wasn’t so sure whether I entered the right  entrance initially, since the exterior seemed like a warehouse. But once we entered, I love the rustic feel of the cafe and the laid back vibe. Went on a weekend evening and it was not crowded, and food was really good. I would definitely come here again.
Great food at great prices!
I wanted to visit the place as I love cycling and the idea and design seemed so cool. However I was deeply disappointed with service, service staff was very rude. I have read previous reviews and it seems my family was not the only ones who had bad experience with the staff.
Chili crab pasta was good. The sauce and portion was just right. Ambience at night feels comfortable
nice coffee place ...
Food is decent, coffee was disappointing. The beans they used were overly roasted, all I could taste from my latte &amp; flat white was char.
Excellent cafe with a cycling theme. Great service.

Good place to chill out
Great food n fresh ingredients - chili crab pasta, pork belly rice - and my daughter claims they have the best ice lemon tea. I liked the ginger lemonade which had a real ginger squeeze in it. The bike section could be better spruced up? Lots of bicycle racks and some uninteresting city bikes on display.

Good service. Nice place.most people didn&#39;t know that it will close at 3pm.  Best to do a reservation before dropping in.
Over rated. Food below average : katsu is too hard to chew, and too dark in colour. Egg Benedict below average : Taste is below expectation. Service : average
Prices are on the high side. Service staff doesn&#39;t seem to know her products. Food tasted ordinary for a premium price.
Nice food and atmosphere. Fish and chip (top up for truffle fries) / Chicken with waffles / pork ribs - nice taste.

Nice ambiance and good food!
Good food
Weekday visit and place is rather deserted. Food is cold, horrid, latte is OK. IG overrated.
Bad experience with a very inflexible manager.
Highly recommend!!!! Food was good, so was ambience and service, though food was on the slightly pricier side, but super worth it for the taste
Different place to dine in.
Atmospheric large retro industrial space that surprisingly does not get too noisy.  Good coffee and the parmesan crusted salmon was cooked perfectly.
No much bike to see compare last time, due to convid 19. But still pack at the cafe.
Lovely ambience, and great coffee
The location and design of this cafe is really appealing but the service is mediocre. Ordered an oat milk flat white. The staff member warned me it was very sweet 🤨. I decided to give it a go anyway. It was very hard to drink. Syrupy and in no way a flat white of any kind should be served. Will not visit again. …
I&#39;d recommend their chilli crab pasta and 60 degrees chicken breast. the former was savoury and delectable. its soft shell crab was very easy to eat and fresh. for the latter, the chicken meat was perfectly cooked and tender. its mashed …

Unique ambience so nice to try, but just can&#39;t get over the non-freshness of the crab and fish:-( Squid tastes nice
Location is out of the way. Parking is limited. Food is good! Price is alright. Gotten the navho fries with the $10 IPA and a squid and pasta. Would come again with more people to share food
Looks like an old warehouse from the outside, but very nice and clean interior, including the toilet. Ordered the fish&amp;chips and chilli crab pasta. Presentation looks decent, however the fish and the softshell crab tasted quite fishy, …

Very cool little cafe/restaurant. Would be awesome for lunch or afternoon. Beer on tap. Great, attentive service. Bar snacks were tasty and ribs were also well done. Will definitely be back! Love the bikes and workshop. Fabulous space.
This place is like a place I would want to make it as my loft. Ambience and space are all great for hanging out for lunch or brunch with friends. Since it is not a halal place, I could only try their crab pasta and it was good. And the drip coffee and honey drinks.
Wheelers Yard Bicycle themed cafe housed in a warehouse just off Balestier. Food drifts to more bistro fare type rather than all day breakfasts. We recommend the Beef Yard …
Nice and spacious cafe in an industrial area to chill out as it is less crowded. Usually is very crowded during weekend, so best to come on weekday off perk. They have a great selection of food and drink. Love the Summer IPA + truffle fries. Price is on the higher side as the same as many cafes in Singapore.
Good place to chill in the area. Food is a bit pricey. Overall good.
Sharing for the Brekkie , big portions for 2 pax, nice latte, cozy cafe but not near to MRT

Have yet to experience the food but I did so at another Wheeler’s state - Wheeler’s Estate. Both estate and yard - the landscape and atmosphere are great with greenery and …
Nice place for gather. Tried dessert, will come back for main course in due time.
🚲 &amp; ☕️ Good place for brunch. Generous amount of food. Fast service. …
Bad attitude from the boss, food tastes normal but expensive. Not worth
Nice place to chill
Nice place to chill
Great experience.
Delicious in every way! I tried the suki beef bowl and oh the flavors were wonderful! The beef was extremely tender and when mixed w the egg and rice just enhanced it flavor even more! The tangy kombucha was also quite tasty! The flavors …
Love the fish and chips with a Japanese seasoning touch to it. The avocado toast was great too although it might have been a lil heavy for me.
Tried the black pepper lime squid, 60° sous vide chicken breast and chilli crab pasta. One word, solid.
Fish and chips were perfect! Loved the spacious relaxed interior too :)
Food is so so but ambience is great!
Service was prompt and good. Went on a Sunday evening and didn’t have to make a reservation. Food was super worth it because we used burpple beyond where we get 2 main courses + 2 drinks for just $24++! 😊 would return for a quiet &amp; decent meal! …
Came here for lunch as I was around the area and this place is indeed really instagrammable! This cafe location is not the most convenient as it is at an industrial area. Atmosphere is great and food is tasty too! Had the chicken breast and it’s so soft and juicy. Service was also really efficient despite the lunch crowd. Worth the try!
Food was alright will come back again
Pork belly very smell, seems to be not fresh and store for certain period, other foods average
Good place for a meal. The seating can be a little weird with tables set in a fashion you&#39;re sitting next to your companion unless you reserve a table in advance. Food is good for the price point.
The waffle here was simply delicious ! It was something different from your usual cafe waffle with the thick crust. This has a banana after taste and it was cut into heart shaped pieces which was easy for sharing. Coffee was good and can I …
Cosy place with good food.
They took pretty long to serve out dishes but the dessert (waffle w ice cream) was served when we have just started to eat the main course. …
Didn’t update no dog policy wasted a trip there and cab fares really disappointed
Great coffee!  Nice venue.
Came at 10:30 on a Saturday morning. Not too crowded. Quite some people came as walk-in and they can easily get a seat. The place wasn’t full when we left close to noon as well. …
Amazing food and nice coffee!!!
A decent hipster joint. The food is okay but I felt was a bit pricey. We had the beef and vegetable bowl and it cost about 50 bucks including a lemon tea. Due to void the seating arrangement is also a bit odd but still pack with lots of people. Parking can be a problem though. So might need to drop off and park elsewhere.
Nice surroundings, decent service. Yummy food. It&#39;s full house over the weekend and staff did serve us water and top it up once. …
A special place to dine in. Nice food and friendly staffs! Here I comes again ! Lunch with good friends and met the owner too!
Bring back nostalgic memories of yesteryear.
Cyclists’ cafe
The food is expensive and the quality is nowhere near the price. The service was bad too. Everything was self service when we were there. Very disappointed. Not going to go again.
Food: 2/5 poach egg overcook Service: 3/5 Price: 2/5 ($25/pax) …
Great little cafe off balestier road. Friendly service Food was ok.
Uncomfortable seating arrangement for 3pax and below groups. You&#39;ll be seated at the huge table in the middle, bar style. So it&#39;s hard to have conversations and you&#39;re &#34;competing&#34; with another group seated directly …
Not pet friendly. Not sure why some reviews say it is.
Fresh Snapper Fish and Chips !!!!! 🐟🐟🐟 …
Cosy cafe in Balestier area. Bicycle warehouse interior design. Good menu with food &amp; drinks. Parking is available next door, FOC. Nice place for catching up with friends over a meal or coffee.
Poor service, bad queue management, inattentive staff more concerned with their phone
Pretty cool place
Deco is beautiful and vintage, but food is a bit pricy.
Good and quirky cafe with fairly decent food. Can get pretty crowded so do expect to wait a little to get a seat and further waiting for food to be served (waited 30mins for my coffee). Free parking available.
Burpple 1 for 1. 2 mains and 2 drinks. Paid $30  in total. Chicken breast was Super tender. Unfortunately, it was bland and requires packet chilli as complement. Porky Bowl was normal rice bowl with bacon, nothing special. Recommend to drive there due to free parking at the building beside. Ambience was quite unique. 3 stars
Great place for brunch, the location is amazing in a factory like building and next the river, perfect for afternoon walk as well. The food is good but not outstanding.
Nice ambience, food is good
Great place in Novena. Generous dishes, laid back vibe, good coffee and friendly service in a quirky interesting place. Chilli crab linguine and the grilled cheese are both good
A surprise find in the middle of the industrial estate. The place was cosy and have good ambiance. We enjoyed the food and coffee. Fish &amp; chips were good, fish was fried to …
A very unique instagrammable place. The design, setup and ambience is worth a visit. I&#39;m into bikes but I guess it is too late for bike accessories. We tried the food here and they were awesome. The fish &amp; chips had a lovely crisp and hot …
very poor coffee, bland and one-dimensional. can&#39;t say anything about the food since i didn&#39;t try it but would not come back for coffee alone.
Interesting deco in a ulu place. Coffee was not bad. Did not try the food.
Cosy place good chillin vibes. Food so delicious!!! Bycycle motorbike park. Carpark can park next door if full. Its legit!
Love the unique ambience. My daughters say it is a very instagramable place for young people to hang out. Well, I am still young at 66.
Nice setting, attentive service, great food. Waffles are a must try!
Cosy retro place.  Nice ambience.
It&#39;s my first time trying this place. Liked the online reservation process. The place is very retro and the food were nice. Ate the pork tonkatsu toast &amp; garlic toast. Great place for fusion food &amp; catching up.
Food is so-so. Had the seafood aglio olio and what came was a very small portion of pasta with only 3 (very sandy) mussels. Incredibly oily too. Service staff was great and attentive though. Pity the food standard.
Food wasn&#39;t great. Some dishes not according to standard. Squid batter was a bit gummy.
Food is yummy, place is nice, servers are friendly! Awesome cafe to dine in!
Was with a friend, excited to try this place because of all the reviews. Went on a Thursday evening, 6pm. Was &#34;greeted&#34; in a snappy manner by a young lady. Thought nothing of it, cause maybe it was just a bad day for that 1 girl. Came in, …
Ambience is great. P.S. THIS PLACE IS NOT PET FRIENDLY!!! Please do not trust the other reviews or blogs that say this place is pet friendly. They do not allow pets.
Nice ambience with friendly service!
Nice hidden gem in the enclave of the industrial area to chill. It serves nice drink and food with quiet ambience to sum up the ideal place for you to have a great chat with anyone. Price is reasonable and for vintage bicycle lover a great place to see too. Try it out!
I love the vegetable rice bowl. The rice is japanese rice and it taste really healthy. The impossible burger is great as well! The chili crab is soft shell crab
Good food, nice environment to chill 🙌🏿 …
Staffs are rude, bad seating arrangement.
Food is fine.  Cannot remember your tattered chair C32 OR C31! The torn cushion bits and pieces …
Surprisingly the owner is former 70s motocross Rider Yamaha sponsor  Mr Ong , the legendary 1st generation motocross in Singapore 😉🥰🥰🥰 …
location kinda out ambience not too bad had …
Nice and quiet place.. Good place to walk around too..
Good food and great ambience.
Cool and chilling cafe, not only concept food is very nice too
Food was not bad, but overpriced. Fish and chips was 19++, the fish was good but the portion was small, while the chips were a bit too salty. Nice atmosphere, I would visit it much more often if not for the price.
Great stuff for bike
I love the quaint and rustic decor. Staff are friendly and helpful. The coffee is very good.
Cold drip coffee is heavenly!! Love the vibe to this place!! This is like the hidden jem of Balestier!! …
Food is slightly pricey but it&#39;s good!  From the bar snacks, the Furikake cauliflower, black pepper lime squid and …
Great place.. A bit of a maze to get there though but if you&#39;re driving or riding, shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Quite a throwback as its a vintage theme.. A bit of nostalgic moment when I&#39;m there.. Didn&#39;t get to visit the &#34;makan&#34; section.. Went …
Rustic place, food was great
A hidden cafe in a quiet area. Place is spacious and high. Staff are attentive in their service. Food is good, but there are hits and misses in some of their brunch menu. Masala chair latte is recommended though it is more masala than chai. …
Nice place, original food and drinks, nice staff. You need to book in advance for the weekends because is always full. The crab pasta looks really good.
Interesting place. Service is good. Food is good. Please keep track on your wine inventory. Disappointed, order the wine but was told dont have stock available.
Rather exp cafe food
I think the quality of food is decent, especially the food which I ordered in these pictures. For a cafe themed eatery it’s selling the concept of the ambience and is worth the occasional trip. The portion of fish is only one piece and for …
Good ambience and coffee place. Good to take photos.
Great atmosphere. Squid is fresh. Fish and chips nicely done. Unique potato cuts.
we are sorely disappointed with the babycino and cake.  the cake is reasonable priced 7++ but sucks. the babycino which we asked for …
Good food and unique atmosphere. Very limited options for vegetarians though.
Quite a good hangout place in the middle of a hidden neighbour hood... but food wise I would say it’s ordinary and nth too fancy. But ambience definitely made up for it
Interesting cafe/restaurant in a warehouse in the Balestier area. Since it&#39;s right off the PCN passing through the whampoa area, it&#39;s more convenient to access if you&#39;re cycling, than if you&#39;re driving. …
A bike cafe that doesn’t have a proper place for customers to park their bikes. All the red useless bikes by the entrance are there (for show?) but for some reason we have to park out bikes at the back. Alright fine, but no one is keeping …
Just want to try something new for lunch, then come here. but to my disappointment, the portion and taste is far overpriced for $20, nothing comparable to the pictures on the menu, bread is small, ham is thin and vegetables are not fresh …
Good atmosphere but food wise taste was okay. But visually very instagram worthy
Nice ambiance and hipster vibes. a bit too crowded for my liking. Unique menu but a tad bit overpriced

Very chill place for brunch.
Sunday  :The interior is awesome i would like to recommend all to come visit at least once. The place is instalgramable. As a frequent cafe hopper, i find the food /beverage/cakes on the average safe …
Nice food,  use to have lots of bicycle 🚲 on sale, not any more, food still good, good portion, nice presentation. …
Eclectic, bike-themed, neighborhood, warehouse cafe. Lots free parking on weekends. Small portions for the money.
love the bicycle themed cafe and its whole concept is really amazing. The latte is nice and at affordable price.
Lime squid was lovely ...cakes was awesome .......but price was steep for small portions ...and it&#39;s not really a  &#39;$$&#39; rating ...its more like &#39;$$.5&#39; Ambience interesting but not everyone&#39;s cup of tea  ....it&#39;s also a little out …
Unique location and very impressive interiors. Food is great. Fish and chips abit overpriced i felt. Otherwise chill vibes
Bicycle shop that doubles as a cafe. Ambient was good however service crews were not  enthusiastic. Cakes were okay. Signature  ice ball coffee were blunt tasting. Indoor seating, air-conditioned. Price was fair.
A cafe incorporated within a bicycle shop! Really innovative, and they have really nice ambience and decorations. Tried their Durian chocolate cake, Boston cheese cake, Ice ball coffee and Match Latte. The matcha latte was really nice and …
Went with friends for a drink. Interesting concept. However, I was disappointed with the attitude. The chocolate milkshake is below average. But the environment is pleasant, but operating hours make you feel that you are chased through the …
This place is quite secluded but surprisingly there is a crowd ..food is expensive and service is ok only I don&#39;t see what&#39;s the hype here .. the food is normal too . Just got an apple pie with ice cream .. chocolate milkshake and truffles …

Coffee is good, environment is good, food is decent, service kinda meh. The server kinda makes you appreciate foreigners in our service industry. Can&#39;t blame the servers though. Someone needs to write a better SOP and conduct proper …
This cafe restaurant have an unusual interior of a warehouse. Nice place for photos, cozy environment with food that is also very photogenic.
Nice quiet place with free parking and finger food
The cafe&#39;s concept is pretty impressive but the food is considered on the average side. The price is abit pricey based on quality of the food.
Interesting hide-out cafe but its a pity that the bike shop is winding out of business.
Not crowded... Great for a quiet gathering... Free parking.... Food is pretty okay... Price is reasonable too...
Food is less than mediocre. Not worth the money. Scrambled eggs are watery, toast is barely toasted, the bacon is a piece of wood. Where are the eggs of the French toast?
Decent drinks.
I don&#39;t usually write reviews but I feel like this has to be said. I have lived in balestier for the last coming 4 years and have visited Wheelers about a dozen times. Although portion sizes are decent, food is alright at best(even after …
Real bad service
It’s more dramatic in pictures but in real it’s kinda alright. Limited food options and the fish and chips was so dry, wouldn’t recommend. One time experience 👍🏼 …
Mediocre experience in the past but came back Cos they were dog friendly. Unfortunately pets are no longer tolerated Cos they removed the outdoor sitting. “No pets allowed” signs are everywhere. No reason to come back I guess.
Just note that Wheeler&#39;s Yard is not pet-friendly.
Food was great, location is off the beaten track so definitely taxi here, and plenty of hipster vibes. …

The food is delicious but the prices are very expensive. I really enjoyed the seafood spaghetti but wouldn’t be able to continuously go back for it because I’d run out of money.
The coffee is very well executed with good texture, temperature and no foam. The milk (Meiji) is fine too but the problem is the flavour of the beans. I remember the flavour being more robust some years back when they used Karajoz beans. Not sure what’s used now.
Great for  …
Interesting and cosy cafe serving western food and drinks in Balestier.
Came on a Saturday noon time. Acceptance and cozy crowds. Simple and yummy food for sharing. Generous serving of vegetables for mains.
Was here with then-gf 2 years ago dating. Back today for the 4th time. Always ordered the 60degC chicken breast. Tenderness at its perfection. Seafood aglio olio was also not disappointing. Same great ambience on a Saturday afternoon. Will be back for a 5th.
Wanted to eat a tomato based pasta and did not know its a kids pasta. When i ordered the waiter was giving me a very uncomfortable and judgemental stare and look. I asked if its possible cos i was craving for it and portion did not matter …
Unique dining place in what seems like a warehouse with bicycles as decoration. Food is not bad.
Such a cozy yet chic place! Excellent food and tasty too. Good to have a reservation if you are coming in a group. Their prices are mid range however, their portions are reasonably big. Must try their Chlli Crab Pasta. Something different …
Very good coffee and friendly service. Good selection of food and drinks. Right next to the park connector you can just ride your bike in.
Tasty food in a cool location
Had a pleasant tea break, the atmosphere cozy. The salted caramel cake is quite good, coffee is ok.
fun place with nice staff, good food.
Rather pricey but the quality is there. Ordered a number of items including the burger and Suki bowl, the taste was on point and the doneness perfect. portions are decent. Ambience is pretty amazing, love the design and feel, can&#39;t quite get this anywhere else in Singapore. Parking will be tricky if there are more people visiting.
Kind of sad over the service and food. And the table is not well cleaned. It&#39;s very sticky. The lady server isn&#39;t friendly at all and have attitude problem. And the fries served are not hot either when we feedback they just bring it back …
Great ambience for afternoon tea with cake
Excellent coffees, interesting snacks and very unique decor!
Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch. The place is located at a quaint area which can be reached by bus or cab. They also have free parking in the building beside. …
French toast was more like a doughnut, and portions overall were quite small for that price. Coffee was nice. Would only go for the ambience.
Super luv this old school ambience..brought back many childhood memories such as the super old metal type of toilet door and barber chairs...cosy and a place that I can spent a whole day in due to its peacefulness! As for food, the beef in …
Like the ambience. Heard from the waiter that they have been in business for more than 6 years.
I&#39;m staying next door so I Dun hve much to say bt u shd go there to see for urself...
Went there on a sun for bunch (free parking available). A bicycle themed cafe with cosy setting and good food. There was also a mini garage sale outside the cafe.
Parking is a problem. Variety of beer is limited. Warm.. ac isn&#39;t cold. Not recommended.
Garbage venue, poor service
Somewhat decent food today. Did not have good food prior. But today&#39;s Porky bowl was surprisingly decent. Not fantastic but decent.
Nice place to chill on weekday afternoons.
A jewel in the midst
Bicycle themed cafe. Great for group meetings or cafe dates. Will recommend the beef burger. Price is above average
Nothing amazing but better than average. Nice to drop by for its uniqueness. We had the sous vide chicken+waffles and BBQ ribs. The ribs sauce was more sweet than savoury and comes with a healthy amount of salad.
Nice place
Nice place
Nice ambience and spacious. Grille chicken is tasty. Good place for a gathering with your loved ones. Limited free parking.
A very interesting cafe. It’s in the midst of industrial looking buildings and the shop looks like one too! They offer free parking as well and you will immediately see the flashing signboard telling you it’s free! The ambient was great, a …
If you want to go to a place that&#39;s insta-worthy and have nothing else to offer then this place is for you. The food is horrible for the price
Food is below average. Ordered the avocado French toast,  barely find avocado, parma ham taste weird and smelly, bread got smell and extremely dry.  Very dissapointed
Hippy cafe. Came by during our morning walk from tpy. Typical customers are youngsters and westerners. Decent for choices and decor.
Fish &amp; chip is nice especially with truffle fries. BBQ sauce pork ribs equally gd too but if they hv selection other than BBQ sauce will be better. Will come again.
Nice cold drip coffee, relaxed and comfy ambience
Always nice to be here Cool place good coffee
Awesome espresso ball. Fun to shop the bike store too!
This is a good place for chilling out and catching up with friends. Food is delicious and coffee is nice too! Staff is attentive to customers&#39; needs. They respond very promptly when help is needed.
Located off the busy road it&#39;s a bicycle service station with a cafe. Serving decent food and cafe prices, I had the fish and chips. Potato wedges were nicely flavored and well cooked but the fish was a little on the small side. Overall a quiet place to hang out at.
I was told that I couldn&#39;t have the individual table seats as they were for those with reservation (i.e. 4 pax or more). As the place wasn&#39;t crowded(even the individual tables were not filled) on a weekend lunchtime, it wasn&#39;t too bad …
Lots of improvement in terms of food and service. Staff is friendly and well trained.
Good environment. Average food quality.
Nice cosy place, the service from the cashier is pretty bad though. Won’t be coming back for that.
It was quiet when I visited around lunch on Saturday. It has interesting, quaint decor - cycling stuff... really nice and casual place... Brunch was nice... We order this waffle pancake for dessert and that was great! We also had a drink …
Food - disappointed. Not worth paying for such average standard.  Cakes - carrot not fresh. Cream has weird taste.
Rustic ambience, lots of seating, interesting deco, Instagram worthy location... Food was top notch.
Food is awesome. Ordered aglio olio spaghetti and it tasted so good, portion was just nice too. Had a set and the salad is yummy too. Thumbs up for a hidden gem in Balestiar area!
This place is quite hard to find.....but it is worth the travel. It’s a very unique cafe.
Cosy
Spacious space for a relaxing afternoon with delicious coffee.
Great place for family only
Loved the vibe of this place and the bike shop. The prices are not cheap, and the cocktails are not strong, but the food was great and we had fun at our team outing
Nice chilling place with good coffee. Hopefully, next time we would come by the bikes.
Great place to chill
A very okay place to have brunch. The food isn’t great, just passable. Don’t order the avo toast, it ain’t great and they toast your Parma ham! You might as well use bacon. That’s just inappropriate handling of food. And the guac was just …
Ambience is nice and cozy. Presentation of food items are wonderful. Food taste average. Visited on a Saturday night and it was too crowded. Staff can be impolite such as taking the menu away without asking or using the table as a place to rest their basket of glasses while they arrange the glasses for the water.
Great place to catch up with friends over coffee/brunch. Had the truffle fries, soft shell crab pasta, and the big breakfast. All good but would have preferred the toast in the big breakfast to be sourdough or wholemeal! Note: if you’re …

Pleasantly surprised with the food - seemed more like a cafe and dessert place but we had good fish and chips, plus roasted chicken and waffle.
The building and interior of the restaurant is amazing. Definitely a showstopper and a place to bring to impress your friends. However, though the plating was equally impressive, the taste of the food is average. What was worthy of …
Always a good place for coffee, good for cyclists too
Lame and the food is not even one star good. Waste of money.
Dogs friendly, price reasonable.
Nice food and space with slow service
Great place for a cold brew coffee!
Unique cafe with a cozy ambiance for biker and for anyone.
The ambient is perfect for chit chat... free flow water...
The location is difficult to reach using public transportation, so I r …
The chicken salad and the burger were delicious! Will return!
Interesting decor here. As it is also a bike shop, there are a lot of bikes as well as rubber smell :D …

Very interesting hangout place, like the setup. Food decent.
Cozy place to chill with friends. Never ate the food here but drinks are okay and reasonably priced.
Nice place for casual hangout with friends to have a meal and drink.
Best fish and chips I have ever had - fish was really fresh and chips perfectly done. Amazing. Actually very good value for the quality, portion size, good service and ambience 👍 …
Great place. Friendly staff and good food. Nice environment. 😊👍 …
Love the interior and all the decorations! This place is for bike lovers out there. Not just the decors but the food is delicious too!
Very interesting decoration with lots of bicycles. Good ambient, good food, coffee and service. Very suitable for breakfast or brunch on weekend. …
Coffee doughnut and iced latte plus the relaxed vibes makes the place and ĺpretty memorable
Good food
Cool place. Hope it does not close down because it is tucked away
Terrible acoustics. Gets crazy loud in here. 😱 Amazing venue otherwise. …
Friendly and lovely decorated place Food is nice
Great food  great atmosphere....must try
They have the worst food. Worst service and have the dumbest rules in this place. Brainless.
Hard to get there,  but food is good. Although it’s more expensive...  service was good.
Unique cafe with a bicycle theme. The Fish and Chips (with truffles fries) and 60 Celcius Chicken Breast was boomzzz!! To add on, the iced espresso ball was impressive! Lastly, a little shout out to this PT crew - bevelyn! Her service was excellent! 👍👍👍 …
Still surviving
Great vibes
Nice place to hang around. Decent food.
I love their rice bowls, latte and dessert.
4th visit - service staff is still fantastic. Masala chai tea is the best I had in sgp. Very fragrance smell. The herbs infused with tea is just correct proportion. Deep fry shishamo fish is tasty yet not oily. …
Out of the way location. Nice place for a layback afternoon. Food and drinks is over priced. Typical cafe food.
Nostaglic bike yard for coffee and all things on two wheels
great  atmosphere.  the place gets a bit crowded during weekend brunch.
Although a little hard to locate, the place is very cozy with a nice touch of industrial vibe. Definitely not many such places in and around Singapore. Food was decent and I do enjoy some creative touches to the food. Must say that coffee …
Cozy cafe for especially bike lovers. Away from MRT station and not easy to find this place. …
Get the hipster coffee :)
Mediocre food. Katsu tastes like cardboard. Air conditioning wasn&#39;t working when we were there.
good
Clean and spacious, clean bathrooms too. It’s mostly self service, means it’s efficient too. Didn’t have to wait too long for food, good beer on draft. Parking is limited otherwise it will be a 5 star!
A nice hidden gem, good food and drinks. Quite expensive
Had dinner here, location a bit inside but worth the visit. Cozy place with nice aircond and clean dining place. Ordered the porky bowl and the hulk. The rice bowl taste good, only the pork is …
the food is not worth the price. mentaiko pasta tasted off. the brownie picture look nice but hard and dry.
Nice food.  Even nicer ambient
Cozy Place for Food with Frenz.
A cosy themed Cage. Good was average
A bit expensive for me but the food is super good. Dessert cakes usually too sweet for me but I think It is fine for the others.
Nice cozy place for a drink and meal. The ambiance is good, service is good, food variety and pricing are decent. It is located off Balestier Road, in an old (and nicely decorated) warehouse. Parking is an issue however; but is is connected to the park connector so getting there by bike is simple.
Very bad service. Staff did not bother to entertain request to change sides. Food quality was good but overall experience was totally spoilt with their service.
Good food and great environment. The bicycle parts and peripherals are great.
Nice place to chill for bikers. Food is nice just that it is slightly dark.
Although location can be quite inaccessible, it is still worth to visit this cafe, it’s good for catch up session with friends. Coffee is good too.
High sealing makes me relax. Since the locution is distance from MRT and bus, atmosphere is peaceful.
Instagram worthy cafe that worth going once.
Amazing food and cool beer. Family frendly. Good for a Sunday afternoon but can get busy.

Really good place to have the weekend brunch to hang out with the friends, or chilled by yourself. The bicycle theme café you can find so many things about bicycle. And coffee is very good. And the wine collection is great too.
Interesting place to have group gathering or brunch
Mentaiko pasta a bit on the thin side
I have always been a fan of egg bens. So the thought of having all day brekkie till 3pm is just my kinda place 😉 …
Drinks are awesome.
the setting was cosy and family friendly. food was good and price was reasonable.
Food was great!!
Nice cafe for coffee and cakes. The food here is pretty good too. Very limited parking space though.
Cosy place with nice foods
A very unique cafe w/ a cozy ambiance. It&#39;s very spacious and didn&#39;t have too much crowd when we went there. They also sell bicycle accessories aside from their delicious food. This cafe is perfect for people who love bicycles.
Food is ok only, but nice place to bring pets
Been here a couple of weeks ago with my partner, ordered the beef bowl and mentaiko spaghetti. The mentaiko spaghetti didn&#39;t have a strong flavor aside from being creamy, it wasn&#39;t  very tasty. But the beef bowl wasn&#39;t bad, even the daikon …
Nice spacious bistro. Came here at 4 pm and there wasn&#39;t much of a crowd. You can get a full meal here and there is only one kids meal set. However I would recommend to just order the full portion of food to share with the kids. Limit free …
Food is good. Cafe is comfortable for chilling out. There is a dedicated section for bicycle enthusiasts that is selling bicycle accessories and parts.
horrendous service with lousy food. Will never visit again.
Lazy staff, lousy food, dirty tables. Overpriced. It&#39;s a no no
Awesome atmosphere and service.
Nice coffee, decently priced upwards of $4.50, air conditioned and bicycle themed :D
Apart from the insanely popular front yard of the cafe - just check out how many posts on Instagram feature the now iconic blue metal garage of the cafe - there&#39;s nothing awesome about this place. In fact, this place fares below the average …
A unique brunch place as well as a place where bike aficiandos can buy bikes and their relevant equipments/parts. The food and coffee are pretty good. Unfortunately taking one star off as the food may take too long to prepare and the staffs may look a bit disorganized. But, overall it&#39;s a nice place to dine in as well to take photos in.
Interesting venue within a warehouse that also retail and service bicycles. Parking can be a challenge here due to limited parking availability.
Great place to hang out and catch up with friends for coffee, brunch or a meal. Food is generally good, above average and coffees are decent. They also serve up craft beers though limited, but also other alcoholic beverages. …
Great food and great atmosphere.  Price is average.
Ordered the chicken &amp; waffle, Porky Bowl and Truffle Fries.  The pork bowl was average with the doneness of the egg being too overcooked for …
Nice place to hang around for coffee. Cool place for bicycle lovers with interior decorated with classic bikes
Hidden from the main road of Balisteir is this gem of a bike shop cum cafe. Limiting parking up front and can get busy during weekend brunch. Good get together place for dinner among friends as well
Very cool place even it’s busy all the time still worth visiting
Nice ambience, but food is OK but isn&#39;t really value-for-money, as expected of brunch places like this.
Decent decor, average food, pricey menu  Potential patrons need to know the following: …
This is very unique cafe. Its concept can be accepted by outdoor lovers, cyclist, motorcycle lovers etc Their tomato soup is tasty, if you want a bit salt will make it much better. Fish &amp; chips is typical one, I’d like to recommend vegetable rice bowl.
A hip place to enjoy good food.  Great place for group gathering as the place provides big square table that can accommodate more than 10-15 people.  It is also a great place for photo taking with bikes.
place is nice and quite （have background music） suki beef rice bowl -$19.9 espresso -$4.5 include GST
More for teenagers
Ok food and coffee. The food was served a bit slow. The place looks good.
Unique design for a bicycle and cafe place. Food is excellent and the atmosphere is good. Note there is not much parking space and the area is not conducive for parking.
Very rude staff as they say it&#39;s kids friendly but it&#39;s not. Food is ok only and pricey for the quality. Looks so dusty and run down compared to the pics they have out .I was not happy will never ever go there.
Nice place for a drink
Food taste great. Atmosphere very cosy and spacious.
The good: no service charge no GST. The bad: feels like eating at a foodcourt cos order at counter and get a buzzer and collect from kitchen counter yourself. They don’t even give serviettes on …
Relax and quiet for a leisure afternoon.
Really cool vibe. Reminds me of when I lived in New York. Has a Bushwick/Brooklyn vibe which is maybe under appreciated in Singapore. Went around 6pm for a coffee. It was very chill, not too crowded. Nice space. The coffee was also very …
3 stars mostly for the ambience. Loved the theme, decor and hipster vibes. It was quiet enough for good coversations. Food was mediocre tho.  We had the beef bowl and chicken breast.
Cute little restraunt seated near a bike path. It also has a small bike shop too. Food isnt awesome, but it isnt horrible either. Really recommend checking out this cute little restraunt!!
Service is a bit faceless, which is not ok when you run a niche F&amp;b entity. The whole concept is great, personally it feels they could open the potential of this hangar way more
Another trendy hipster cafe.
great atmosphere. little pricey for a la carte but the platter for sharing is good value. On weekends, you can park in the next building over
Interesting place for brunch or a meal. Off Balestier Rd
Hidden at a quiet estate. A great place to hangout with friends.
Poor service. The guy at the cashier was very unempathetic when he said I can&#39;t utilize a Burpple promotion. He sounded very pompous and had a smug look when he mentioned that I had to pay full price. Very unprofessional for a customer service job.
Best Iced long black I&#39;ve had in Singapore so far. Heaps of space to work at the tables, and pretty reasonably priced food
Nice place for a coffee/tea, only the outdoor area is dog friendly,even though they have fans it&#39;s quite hot, outdoor furniture is not very comfortable, they could make more effort for the outdoor ambience, however the indoor area is nice, prices are above average but the quality is good.
Nice food, ok prices, self service, really bad location
Nice and friendly staff, accommodating to make arrgt for children&#39;s chair and high back for the elderly. Food is of good standard quiet environment for brunch hours...
Wow
One of the hidden gems in heartland! Food is really good and Servive is really fast.
Having a cup of hot chocolate tastes bland and carrot cake is average. Accessible for wheelchair bound person
A cool place but the food menu wasn’t particularly expansive. Worth a visit
Cool decor. Food is fine.
Quaint and nice spot. Dog friendly. Cafe type food, reasonable prices
This is one of the must go cafes for cafe hoppers (since it’s pretty popular too). Finally made it down here because of a deal I bought from Chope. The food is really great and is really great for a brunch. …
Nice ambience! Cool place
Nice food and environment for brunch and lunch
I am very disappointed with buying a Chope voucher through Wheelers yard. The expiry was January 2 and I understand that there is no extension. However, I showed them my Doctor’s certificate that I was seriously sick from last week of …
Excellent food and. Service

Crowded in weekends, nice alternative place
Good coffee but their beef burger was bad. And for 27.90 save the money. Eat somewhere else.
Food quality was great. Loved the atmosphere though it can get noisy when it&#39;s crowded. Still an enjoyable place to have bites and coffee.
Nice place to chill and foods are good!
Lovely place but the food suck. Would not be coming back here.
Great dinner experience
Nice atmosphere
Trendy in Singapore
Nice cosy place for a good cuppa Great for groups Have really nice brunch
Nice food and helpful staff! Was a little crowded, which took away a little charm. Do note that the brunch menu cuts off at 3pm-sharp
Cafe was crowded but seats are not fully filled yet but was denied to ALL tables except the table facing out the window. Reason being is that the tables are ‘reserved’ for larger groups with no actual reservation. My first and last time …
“Very good lah!”  The coffee is amazing lah! The location is a bit far off but the decor is so …
Ice Espresso Ball!! Nice!
Expected more since I saw and heard Wheeler&#39;s Yard a lot but it was not as what I have expected. Food wise, I ordered the Porky bowl. It&#39;s just a normal don with bacon. Nothing special. Maybe you should try the beef bowl instead. Saw that a …

If you&#39;re driving it will be more convenient to get there. I did not make any reservation but thankfully 1 was there at 1030 am (Sunday) and managed to get a seat. The crowd was flowing in. Hence probably do a reservation to avoid any …
Great/Excellent coffee! But really expensive mains and sides.  The food portions are also small. So don’t expect to be too pleased if you are going there on an empty stomach. That’s unless you don’t mind dishing out the cash!
good coffee
The cafe is not convenient to access to, but the food and coffee makes it worthwhile. This place is known as a cafe but the food is really great too which is why I consider it as a restaurant. …

Was here with 3 gen family gathering. Food is moderately good. Beer is good. Price? Check out yourself.  Different opinion when i talk to my kids.
Poor service...
I felt that the food was slightly overpriced for the quality. Probably will not return.
Love it
Never regreted visiting here. Food here is excellent!
Deliciously spacious worthy food &amp; chillax but limited lots
Wrong notification on the net. Seems like cycle renting place
Wrong notification on the net. Seems like cycle renting place
Like the warehouse feel!
An offbeat cafe hidden in a yard in Balestier that bikers will love! Food is quite good although its on the high side. Instagram worthy place that suits the young crowd very well. I enjoyed my beef bowl very much.
Out of that way. Had their fish and chips with truffle fries.. nth fantastic
Nice place to relax and chill. Food is average and a bit expensive.
Love the environment! Great food too. My family and kids enjoy the place very much. Get to shop for cycling gear while family is having their meal which is awesome! Staff are friendly too and I highly recommendbthis place
Good place to chill out.
Nice ambience n good food preparation
Go and experience it yourself. I bet you will love it, just like me.
Another nice cafe that I will recommend. Nice place to hang out. It serves nice coffee and food. However, it can be difficult to reach via public transport.
2018/09/18 13:20 loved the food... but saw a rat running across the dining area... staff and management all aware BUT no words from them about the issue... …
Nice place and vibe
Good food great and unique setting. Large tables for big groups. A bit pricey...
Nice cosy place but there&#39;s problem with the air-conditioning.  Very warm and stuff. : sad 😔 …
Nice rustic enclave for a quiet meal.
Suki beef bowl was awesome
Food was average and the space to park is limited for bikes. Smaller than anticipated
this brunch place is at the top of my list! but it is a little tough to get in sometimes due to the popularity. quite like the foood here
Such a wonderful and different place. Love the decor. Great food. Highly recommended.
This is becoming one of my regular joints. Love the ambiance, love the food. Even though it maybe full house, it’s not stuffy due to the high warehouse ceiling. Great place to chill with friends. Brought a photographer Friend from Sweden to hang out and he loved the place. Wheel on guys!!!
Was there for dinner, not crowded. Had to collect your own food and proceed to counter and order yourself. Environment is nice and cozy, good place to relax over an afternoon.
Cozy and nice place to hang out 😊 and can bring ur furry 🐈🐕🐩friend too.. and the food is good too. Bike 🏍🚴‍♂️park go thru the main gate by the ride side small alley …
Uncomfortable chairs for dining in the al fresco area - we had our dog with us; food only so so yet expensive, self service and not much variety; not a convenient location to get to without a car. T e coffee is probably the good thing about this place (I had an affogato).
Food is still ok but slightly overpriced. Guess you&#39;re paying for the atmosphere if you&#39;re into that
Nice change from the norm.
Nice chill place to hangout at. Food is good too
I love the food and the ambience. Bit hard to find as their location is slightly behind the buildings. You wouldn&#39;t think that there is a very good cafe hidden amongst the factory buildings around. Overall all is good and will definitely come back!
Interesting concept cafe
Ambience very attractive . cosy place to gather with friends , staff very friendly .  Food is highly priced .
The bike collection is amazing!
Great all time hang out place
Good chill out place. Lots of photo opps.
The bicycle rack I got is good and affordable!
Good cycle  cafe themed restaurant, good for steaks and western food. The place is kind of deep inside and away from the busy streets, good for team dinners and evening meet ups. The place can be accessed via the PCN so good to take your cycles and get some accessories as well:)
Eclectic cycle-themed cafe with a wide ranging menu.
Tucked away in a little lane off Balestier Road, this is a restaurant with a unique concept. Tastefully remodeled what I imagine is an old warehouse, this eatery uses a bicycle theme for its interior. Outside, you can also purchase …
Great ambience and food! Good for friends and family gathering. Self-service food ordering and collection.
below expectation. place is better to chill but not the food .... sadly
Went with my family and we brought our dog, so we had to sit at their outdoor sitting area (which is about 30 m away from the main indoor area and tucked away in a quiet corner) …
Coool spot. I dig this much
Nice coffee place but overpriced
Coffee and &#34;brunch&#34; here
Love the environment. Food wise is acceptable, not utterly fantastic though
Good food and environment until I arrived home and was up all night with food poisoning. Avoid.
Great setting with average food. Good coffee
Fun atmosphere. Food was good. Recommended if you&#39;re in the area
Nice cozy place with a lot of character.  Formerly a bike shop, people who bike would love this place.  The place is picturesque so snap away. The food was good but a bit on the high side
Relax with food
Cool space, brekkie was big and filling, coffee was a bit on the pricey side
Was there yesterday after work and I really loved it! The coffee is very good and the interior is quite uncommon, which is really nice.  You should stop by and have a cuppa!
Good ambience.  Tasteful design rustic yet modern. Every corner is a photo opportunity.
I love the place. Its cozy.
Great food. Price is not cheap though
Pretty pricey grub, but cute vibes at this place. They serve local Archipelago craft beers.
Nice ambiance, decent food and coffee. 3.5 Stars
Tried the special ice ball coffee. It&#39;s really interesting to see how a place creatively serve good coffee! Hazelnut smell was a good addition. Well done!
Spacious cafe located in an industrial area away from bustling activity on the weekends. Various dishes tasted have been well liked and service including food preparation is prompt.
The price is really friendly, but the quality is okay. If u stays nearby, can have try. But we took taxi to go, it is not worthwhile.
Hidden gem. Love the ambience.
Decent coffee and food. Would patronise if I am in the area.
If not for the parking space available. I love it. Order The Hulk
Nice place for drinks and food
The place have a unique design that gave it a special reputation which diner will come from around Singapore. …
The mentai pasta was too watery!
Very quaint and rustic place nestled away from main street. Has a cosy eating place with  bicycle decor. Also has a bicycle shop catering for repairs and spares.
One of the worst eggs Benedict I&#39;ve had. The English muffin was fairly old and the poached eggs were not cooked right. Also the whole concept of self service could be changed when there&#39;s almost no one in the restaurant. A lot of service …
If you have been in Singapore long enough, you&#39;re bound to have heard of Wheeler&#39;s Yard or have at least seen its photo on Instagram or recommended by food blogs. It&#39;s one of the more well known hipster cafe in Singapore, themed around …
Good food and sublime drinks combined to make this cafe an enchanting cafe to hang out in. Location however means it’s not easy to get to and prices are quite expensive for even coffee. Yet it being a bicycling cafe and next to an actual working bicycle shop/ repair centre makes it a haven for cyclists.
Nice ambience and good food. Got to try the starters: cauliflowers and squids. Main: chicken and bbq ribs are spot on for us. Self service but that’s also mean no service charge.
A bit out of the way, but a chill place to hang out with great food and good happy hour beer prices. You must try the sweet potatoes.
Food standards are so so.. not worth the price..
This place is meh. Saw the decent reviews and decided to give it a try.  The food is mediocre but the people that work here need to be retrained in customer service. Most of the staff didn&#39;t seem like they wanted to be there.  No outlets …
“The food taste great... the place is actually hidden from the outside but perfectly cozy inside.” …
Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and delicious food.
Secluded
Good coffee and good food. Very spacious place which allows me to chill alone.
Nice cafe with a relaxing ambience! Love the warehouse setting with lots of bikes on display and for sale. Good prices are steep,drink prices are okay! …
Really good coffee... worth the bike ride.
A little expensive. Latte 7 sgp$.
Good menu, nice interior. Children-friendly. Reservations recommended for large groups especially on weekends.
Nice food nice ambience
A chillax place for coffee, small plates and mains. Suddenly, one is being transported back to the rustic warehouse feel ... in the 80s with the cool gadgets for the cyclists. …
Spacious interior that can hold larger groups. Self ordering at counter. Desserts are quite good. Don’t really like their home brewed teas though. Insta photo opp at the entrance.
Good environment!
Bike themed cafe with nice ambience and food.
Came here on a Saturday which was surprisingly not that crowded, so they let us have a table all to ourselves. Prices a lil steep tho. Would recommend for dinner!
Food is normal but priced a but high
Bad experience at the cafe. Food is expensive. There is a cake cutting charges if you would like bring in cakes into the premises. There is service charge for food to be served to the table. Dont really understand the hype.....
Love the whole environment of this. Pricing is a little steep but a perfect place to chill out with friends or someone you fancy
The entrance is at the back
Great menu and great service
Spacious n yummy food. Romantic at night
Food is not great and overpriced. Onions soup taste weird. When we provide feedback on onions soup, nobody come to apologise and explain. …
Convenient parking, nice atmosphere.
Nice atmosphere but hmm... Service staff could have smile alittle more and be friendlier.
Good food and fun ambiance. Prices are a little expensive.
Great deco with a certain character to the cafe. The food was good (the egg could be more creamy, a little too watery). The pistachio cake was amazing!
Nice and cozy place to dine in.
Didn&#39;t think that the rawness of the doumiao sprouts matched the eggs benedict. Also, too little hollandaise sauce - was hoping to mask the raw veg taste with the yolk and sauce. …

Good coffee. A bit noisy. Pretty cakes. Cosy.  Updated 2023: …
A little gem hidden away in the DT5 Beauty World Station. Nice cosy coffee aroma. 10 minutes ride by car if you are climbling Bukit Timah hill or your end/start point of the Railway Corridor walk
Nice atmosphere. Outdoor seating is pleasant. Pet friendly. Good service.
Very nice and cozy place with great food, nice drinks and friendly staff. Perfect relaxing place after the green corridor bike ride from Tiong Bahru. 12/02 update: …
Super Good English Brekkie with the lads, good scran, insane vibes, waitress (G) is a peng ting
Fresh bakes are great, a comfortable place for a coffee early morning
Good coffee and pastries. Laid back vibe and friendly service.
Love this place, they have the best coffee and baked products. Great atmosphere too!
We came super early seeing from website that it opens at 8am. However hot food only start serving from 9am onwards. Food slightly on the expensive side and normal tasting. The service and ambience however were excellent!
Good coffee and very good pastries, love their basil croissants
Lovely place with good coffee and cakes. The place is always busy. Love their lemon drizzle cake and carrot cake.
Just discovered this place and really like it. The quiche, ganache cake and frappé were delicious. Will definitely return! 😊 …
Interesting concept using antiques as their props. It’s like back to typical 80/90s houses.
Visited this place for the first time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Crowded but only waited for 5 mins. Good customer service with warm greetings. The pastries on display looks delicious. Order 1 main 1 pastry 1 salad 4 drinks. Total cost …
One of the friendliest and cheeriest cafe staff around. The first time I visited, it was near their closing time, but still the male staff on duty greeted me warmly and even mentioned about some last hour specials they had. I left empty …
Great ambience. Back to the past. Good food and drinks to go along. Nice place to hang out and catch up with friends. …
Cosy cafe exuding old world rustic charm decor wise. The food here was generally quite good, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The food is freshly made, and tastes delicious. …
Brunch is as terrible as it looks. Ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict; was probably made last summer. Hard, tasteless and inhumane. Could probably use the dish as projectiles. …

Popped in with my wife for a light breakfast. The croissant with ham and cheese was delicious. The coffee ok. Servers were sincere and caring. It’s our 2nd visit after many months. Love the ambiance.
Nice relaxing cafe. Nice old fashion decor. Coffee and Croissants are lovely
nice place.. Great services.. excellent food.. reasonable price
Great place with nice deco. Cosy and chill vibe. Always come back for the lemon meringue cake. Had merry trio latte, decent but on the sweet side.
Very wide spread of pastries. Cosy space to chill.
Was looking for a cafe opens early in the morning, found this awesome cafe, walking distance from MRT. Amazing decoration and a lot of unique/antique collection. Good range of pastry, I wish they have more option for veggie (salty ones). Excellent service too!
Cozy place, quaint decor. The lunch menu is limited but it tasted okay. Rather pricy for a set lunch of 1 main, 1 drink and a mini tart, but I’d probably go back to try the pastry on my next visit. …
Absolutely delightful coffee &amp; brunch items in this antique themed cafe. Quality pastries, love at first taste for the 🍓🫐 tart and Croque-Monsieur. …
Lemon meringue and carrot cake are rly nice, used Burpple 1-1. Banoffee was good too. Babycino was not great. Short walk from Beauty World MRT
Posting this because I am annoyed by how the staff seemed to imply I was lying.  I mentioned with full honesty that I had changed my bacon to eggs in the big …
The coffee is better now. Previously the coffee was sour! This time round, the coffee tastes like how coffee should. …
antique shop. All of them are deliciou …
Visit this cafe for early lunch cum BF, here are my direct comments on C&amp;C, Jalan Kilat. (1) Super super expensive. See some part of our bill. …
Came here with a dozen friends. Instinctively liked the place when I sat on a retro metal swing outside the restaurant while waiting for my friends. Inside, the ambience and deco was refreshing - reminiscent of the good old days, e.g. …
We chanced upon carpenter and cook a few months back and have been big fan ever since. …
Nice oldies setting, fragrant coffee and delicious dessert. Great place for high tea. …
Cool cozy place for a quick cuppa
Wide selections of cakes, pastries and brunch options . Standout was definitely the antiques display. Do approach counter staff if you wish to purchase any ornaments.
Second time here, service was friendly. However, I felt that the corn bread could be &#34;cornier&#34; and the lemon meringue cake could be &#34;lemonier&#34;. It would be great if the food had more flavour. Other than that, good place to come on a rainy day and sit outdoors. Chill vibes, fairly quiet.
BEST CLUB SANDWICH AND FRENCH TOAST in town.
Loved the tarts here! The sea salt chocolate tart &amp; passion fruit meringue tart were both v nice. The staff were friendly and the interior decor is quite unique with vintage pieces. Also, they are currently on Burpple beyond so there are quite a few good deals!
bakes are amazing, plenty of (vintage)tables around for everyone
Good pastries here. The pain au raisin was served warmed up. It was flaky and flavourful. Scone was also warmed up and served with clotted cream and jam. Just wish that there be more jam served without the need to ask for more.
Scone with the clotted butter is really good!
My go to place to chill with family, friends, or even for a cup of coffee and some desserts. Reliable, decent, and convenient.
Little quaint cafe in a quiet private estate area. Love seeing antiques in a cafe 💕 Quiche was good. Got a complimentary takeout due to early closing for renovation. Will visit again soon~ …
Absolutely enjoyed the Croque Monsieur. Don’t be fooled by its unassuming exterior.. one bite into it and the perfect harmony of the parmesan, gouda and Dijon bursts in your mouth. Easily one of the best grilled sandwiches I’ve had! …
Came here with my bestest friends and enjoyed the atmosphere. Ordered the pulled pork eggs ben and it was amazing. Pulled pork was juicy and flavoured so well, never tasted such nice cornbread before. …
Had a really awesome experience with my friends at Carpenter and Cook :) I had the crab pasta, and it was great!! The crab meat in the pasta was authentic, fresh and tasty, and food was served hot! My friends had the pulled pork eggs …
It takes about an hour from my house, but it&#39;s one of the few cafes I want to go to once in a while. It&#39;s always crowded on weekends, so if you go alone, it&#39;s  …
Fantastic service! And great food! Will definitely go back again! 👍👍👍 …
A repeater... still enjoying the lemony cake. New try... and you should too... peanutella cake... 3 layers separated by a Nutella layer and a peanut(-jam?) Layer. Enjoy and YOLO!
Nice place to chill and work
I had a very frustrating experience here. After commuting for almost an hour because I was excited to try their brunch, I didn&#39;t end up eating anything because they do not take credit card (or at least, any of my cards) or Apple Pay as …

A delightful cosy cafe to chill at with friends. Amazing food by an amazing bunch of friendly and highly capable staff! …
Great ambience and good food / coffee! Recommended :)
The cafe a bit crowded. Bread and coffee are nice. Hard to find parking here.
Truly one of the best cafes! Their roasted pumpkin salad with cherry vinaigrette, lemon cake and coffee were super great! Chef said they make everything from scratch in cafe itself!
Carpenter &amp; Cook is located at 19 Lorong Kilat Road, Singapore 598120 and nestled within numerous cafes and restaurants, 5 minutes walk from Beauty World MRT. …
Nice coffee and pastries
Cosy ambience, fast service and good food. Great place for a quiet catch up with friends.
Place have decor full of antiques &amp; oldies of the 60s &amp; 70s. Food was average &amp; pricey. $24 plus 7% for a simple big breakfast. The only thing unique in that dish was actually the nice bread. …
Saw from picture looks good hence decided to come to try. Egg benedict is superb together with the pork, but portion a bit small for the price, hence the -1 star, and it seems they reduced from 2 egg benedict to 1 only when comparing to posts from last year (due to raising cost maybe).
the bread  …
Packed in an early Sunday morning with families &amp; friends gathering for pastries &amp; coffee. Found it pricey &amp; perhaps more expensive than Starbucks. Small Latte compared to …
Egg Benedict was alright although kids did not like the alfalfa. For the price they charge for the French toast, I had greater expectations in the both quality and quantity of fruits. The decor of the place is quite interesting.
This cafe is beautifully decorated with all sorts of old furniture from school desks and chairs to church pews to pots and pans from an era past. Sitting here while enjoying a very well prepared coffee and cakes brings you back to your …

Food is average. Service is good. Price is fair. Cleanliness is very good. Decor is excellent. Location is great; in a quiet neighbourhood and it is easy to find. Staffs are efficient. All is good.
good place !
Great cafe situated in Bukit Timah. The cakes and tarts are to die for. Absolutely delicious. …
The place has tasty food but  if you do have allergy or food intolerance this is not the place for you as the menu does not accurately describes the ingredients in each dish. Also, service could use a boost!
Nice ambience.
We tried the cinnamon roll, it was awesome! But the pull pork egg benedict was kind of disappointing. The pull pork was too dry to eat with corn bread. And this portion doesn&#39;t come with any side salad. I feel this is overpriced.
Cosy place for a cup of good coffee and cake &amp; for your information hot foods serve till 2pm only.
Very good meal and quality time with friend was precious without much interruption.
Good service
It&#39;s a good place to have a coffee time …
Pastries are so so
Friendly staff and relax setting for an afternoon chill out. 👍🏻 …
hi!! i usually don’t write reviews for food, but today i went to carpenters and cook and was so disappointed!! previously, the carbonara was $15 and the quality was amazing, i loved the poached egg and the sauce especially. Today, i ate it …
Great coffee, good service. Can be busy at brunch and it’s not difficult to see why.  Nice cosy place deserves 5 stars!
Food is normal. Water cup smells like butter left over
Lovely chic and easy going cafe with local 60s-80s period decor pieces that kinda brings you back a quasi journey in time. Coffee here is always consistent and done with pride. Desserts (croissants, tarts, cakes etc) are consistently good …
Although the water could&#39;ve been more chilled, the food was great alongside the service provided. …
Love the quiches and croissants!
Carpenter and Cook Antique ware aesthetic cafe that serves up homemade bakes and the usual cafe fare. …

Nice place to chill and enjoy their nice pastries.. nice service from the staff and boss..
Fantastic pastries.
Nice food and ambience. With many antiques.
Poor staff attitude.
Club sandwiches, broccoli salad n flat white 🥰 …
Love the warm service and luscious spread of both sweet and savoury pastries! We had a big breakfast - sausage, bacon, mushrooms, scrambled eggs, and brioche. Both my wife and I thot it was missing some tomatoes/greens, and I think it might …
This is our place for carrot cake in Singapore! Coffee is of decent quality (unlike Starbucks and CBTL). Prices are high but it’s kind of the norm in this climate.
We ordered yuzu basil, lemon meringue and salted caramel mini tarts and burnt mocha cheese cake. Loved the yuzu basil and lemon meringue tarts. I had ice black and my friend had flat white. Coffee was average. I think their cakes and pastries are much better. Saw many tabao their pastries and cakes.
I have went to a lot of cafe, so far this place gave the best service and service recovery!
Great afternoon chill. Wonderful selection of tarts and pastries along with coffee. Nice little swing at the entrance to chill too.
This is the worse carbonara pasta I&#39;ve ever had. Very salty, spammed with too much cheese. &#34;Egg sauce&#34; is so clumpy. Might as well call it a cheese pasta.
Nice cafe
Put through a $36 breakfast order, tried to add on a single slice of toast at $2 for my daughter but was refused because none of the other items I ordered were main dishes. I understand that this rule is to prevent people just ordering a …
Eggs Benedict was really poor. Might have just been a bad day for the chicken laying the egg. Might give it another try when the chicken recovers. Pastries were so-so!
Was a little disappointed because I came here thinking that I could do some vintage shopping but there isn&#39;t really much for sale. Still give a 4 star though for it&#39;s cafe part.
A cosy and comfortable cafe with antique style decor. Nice place to have a snack and relax. Very fyiendly staff. Very clean toilet.
The Strawberry Cake is yummy!
Love their coffee and an atmosphere of antique stuff ☕
A cosy cafe
Great place for a simple coffee and pastry
We came here and it was full house. But we manage to get a sit and try their stunning food. It was great experience good food presentation and taste.
This is our first visit here. We came here on a Monday so it&#39;s not too crowded. But it is still full house. Their coffee, food and pastries are all very yummy. I tried their basil pesto pasta (vegetarian) and surprisingly, it is quite delicious. The Nippon Trio cake is nice and not too sweet. Love to come back here again.
A retrospective family cafe which allowed patrons to reminisce the past while enjoying  their delicious meals. Food portion is reasonably big and good for sharing. Good customers service. Need to wait for table during peak hours. The retro items on display are also for sales.
Coffee was great.
Went on a weekday lunch, needed to queue (leave number and they&#39;ll call you).  Best thing about this place, the service staff are really friendly! The staff at …
Nice place
My favorite pastry shop! Love their handmade bakes and pastries. Life is complete with yummy bakes and great coffee.
overall a pretty pleasant experience dinning at carpenter and cook. the staff were friendly and helpful and the place has a very nice ambience to it. ordered some pastries and the french toast! the french toast with fruits was really light …
The cake was delicious, the store was large and I was able to relax.
Great neighborhood cafe hidden along a quiet road of Upper Bukit Timah. Easy to reach but not so many parking lots along the road. There are plenty &#34;antiques&#34; inside this shop and dining in feels like eating in a collection house or museum. …
1. Carbonara sauce was diluted and bland and the pasta was overcooked  2. Eggs benedict was below average and had very little hollandaise sauce …
Good pastries and average coffee/drinks. Food looks good tough the last couple times I went their kitchen was unfortunately closed. …
Super chill out place with some great scones and decent coffee. Brunch on a weekend is a super idea!
A cosy cafe near Beauty World MRT. They have a good selection of baked goods on display - tried one of their pastries (Queen Vic) and it was very good! Light and refreshing.
Nice place to have breakfast. Note that brunch only starts at 9am. Ample parking beside the restaurant. The dish I had (pulled pork) is quite interesting the combination brings out a sweet but not overbearing taste. Salad is fresh and I appreciate that in a dish. Should come if u r in the area!
Mediocore brunch. Service staffs that attended to us is rude.  1. Starting from ushering us from the door, she had given an attitude as if the …
Had a great brunch/lunch here on Saturday! There was only a short wait and service was fast. Food was yummy! Will be adding this to my list of favorite brunch places.
Used entertainer 1 for 1.. Loved the pulled pork egg benedict..
Great coffee, great brunch with a great C&amp;C team.
Tried Carpenter &amp; Cook today. Brunch portion is big (2 ladies if not big eater can share). The broccoli salad is nice, fresh crispy croissant with bacon cheese toast and French toast is good too. But the coffee is too bitter for me. Service is good. No GST no service charge.
Nice place, chill vibes!
Waited 17mins for ice latte when no one is in front of me, 4 staffs doing their own stuff and chatting, the other 2 customers orders behind of me getting their cold drinks faster than me. Is it so hard to make a ice latte? …
Stumbled upon this nice place while waiting to pickup food elsewhere.  Tried the salted caramel chocolate tart &amp; lemon meringue cake. Lemon cake was …
The few cafe with antique items around that area
We went early, but the breakfast starts at 9am, hence get salad and bread instead. Luckily there are various choices of bread. I loved the ham and cheese croissant, the salad of the day was refreshing but …
Excellent service by the staff, especially Annie, the cafe manager/lead. I started going to the cafe in 2020 and the staff have been very warm and friendly, making an effort to remember their customers and orders. I also like how the cafe …
Good coffee and croissant !!! So tasty! Interestingly they serve better pasta than some Italian inspire restaurant ! The only con is, their speed is really quite slow. We waited 25 mins for the pasta to be serve when the cafe wasn’t fully packed.. still a good and cozy cafe to chill at! Will recommend.
Good atmosphere, the food was a bit salty for my liking
Lovely place and the host have been great ensuring that everything is well in place from the time that we checked in.
Here for a lazy afternoon tea. Lemon tarts  are refreshing, the cream is soft and slightly on the sweet side. Cafe’s decor is nostalgia feel but the lighting is too bright. Banoffee filled with banana and nice with thick crispy crust, coffees are meh with sourly taste. Staff are friendly that made up the extra star.
Tried out the Pulled Pork and Smoked Salmon!
Great pastry selection. Do try their &#39;Queen Vic&#39; which is a pastry topped with cream cheese, jam and fruits. Absolutely delicious!
We tried to get a table previously after we done the hiking in bukit timah, but unfortunately failed due to always full house and needed to queue and wait for more than 30 mins. …
My regular haunt after my workout
Like the ambience here. So chill. Also, they have good coffee :) and after trying few cafe, i noticed the cake here is very nice.
Super friendly svc
Try the best tiramisu!
Found the coffee to be slightly above average. It had a chocolaty flavour. Uses the C&amp;C blend roasted by Liberty. Friendly service.
Great service as always! It was my second time here! Love the food and vibe here.☺️
Lemon meringue cake was very light and delicious 👌🏽🤭 …
Lovely little Cafe. Service was warm, efficient and pleasant. Pulled Pork with Poached Eggs was pretty good. Generous serving of well seasoned …
Have visited C&amp;C a couple of times and the highlight of our visits has always been their delicious tarts and bakes. The lemon tart is our absolute favourite with just the right balance of sweet and tangy. …
Environment -Nice place to have brunch after hiking at bukit timah Full of antiquea, is a nice place to hang out with fren n family Staff-Very friendly staff to help in seat arrangment and serving the food👍 Food - Food is the standard brunch taste, would like to try their dessert next time! …
Nice little cafe in the heart of beauty world. Tasty treats, well crafted beverages and very friendly staff. The prices are a little on the higher end but not unreasonable.i look forward to my next experience with some of the meals.
There are tasty, staff friendly and polite
Cozy and interesting vintage decor, tasty food (we had the french toast,  smoked salmon eggs Benedict and mixed berries smoothies).
Croque monisieur - Cheesy sandwich with ham. Smoked salmon eggs Benedict - lack of seasoning and hollandaise sauce. Smoked Salmon has a weird aftertaste. Piccolo and merry trio latte tasted ok
Nice cosy place
A cup of hot coffee Good. The atmosphere is also different, a …
Good: environment is nice.  Bad: food is too oily and salty.
A decent flat white and some amazing baked treats. Quite the hidden gem.
Always love coming here for lunch, the tiramitsu is crazy good, and the pork ragout too! Their pastries  are very nice! Friendly staff and quite full most days! So if you wanna come either book before hand or wait around 20 mins.
Superb coffee place and cupcakes
Superb coffee place and cupcakes
Tables and chairs are very uncomfortable but nice vibes and nice tarts
Good food and drinks. A good place for brunch.
Chillaxing here while waiting for our lunch nearby. Decent #Latte ($5.20), #Mocha($5.70) and #HamAndCheeseCroissant ($6.50). Nostalgic ambience and friendly staff. Didn&#39;t try their #Tarts but they look so nice! 😁 …
Excellent and friendly staff. Great service! Good place to start the day.
Food&#39;s mehhh
Fast and efficient service. Came for lunch on a Friday. Didn&#39;t have problem to get a table. Pulled pork with egg benedict was good. If you&#39;re planning to go here, know that they don&#39;t accept paywave. Only nets or PayNow. No electricity outlet available to charge phone either.
Friendly service!! The lemon meringue cake was really nice; not too tart and not too sweet. Chocolate sea salt tart was nice as well.

I was persuaded to buy the orhnee cake by the baker. The combination of coconut and yam was not something I can imagine, but having tried it, I can testify that it did not disappoint. …
Ambience and the pulled pork sandwich is really good!!
I bought 3 Seasalt chocolate tarts (big), one piece of carrot cake and one piece of pistachio raspberry cake. Upon reaching home, found that the staff had mistakenly pack 3 chocolate tarts (small) instead of the big size one. I called up …
Still open during the Phase 2 restricted measures, and still offering most, if not all, of their menu - making it an excellent drive/cycle-thru option. Coffee is very good, albeit the lad got very muddled with four orders and needed some …
good
friendly staffs

Service was so friendly and welcoming. Had the smoked salmon eggs benedict, not bad. Latte was fantastic. Passion fruit and yuzu basil tarts were interesting.
The food there is delicious!
Good choice of pastries
A very retro decor, good food with decent price, a nice place to chill your afternoon off.
First visit there for lunch today.  Overrated n disappointing. 1. Lousy service. 2. Need to request for cutlery each n every time a meal is served. …
Omg!!! Their chocolate tarts and avocado chocolate smoothy is so heavenly. A beautiful  place to chill that brings back memories with the antique displayed around the cafe. Will definitely come back again.
Great place for brunch! Would recommend the pulled pork
Great service. Not sure if it was an coincidence, my food came tgt with my partner. Which is really nice. Chillax cafe. Not crowded on a weekday
Came here on Sunday for brunch. Have a spread of pastry and cake.  We had pull pork egg benedict, Raspberry, lychee and rose chia seed cake. Pull pork egg benedict comes with home-made corn bread which was yummy and very filling. Many …
Lovely flavourful mushroom soup that I can taste in every spoonful with handmade croutons on the side. What more can I ask for. 🤤 …
Enjoy with their coffee, cake and sandwich
Pulled pork eggs benedict was disappointing, with the cornbread being dense and flaccid. The pork combined poorly with the (well-poached) eggs and cornbread. Salad was drizzled with a zesty sauce, and was a much appreciated diversion from …
I wasn’t a fan of sandwiches until I tried theirs. It may look simple but the combination along with their freshly baked brioche makes it so amazing (and filling too).
Pull pork is nice. Cakes and tarts are nice too. Coffee not up to expectation. Nice ambience and deco.
Lovely ambience and food
Food wise - 4 - Would be great if there’s more Hollandaise Sauce on the Egg Benedict.  Poached egg slightly overcoook. …
The food so so only and the service is poor.
Good food. Staff are friendly. Well decorated cafe. Instagram worthy.
Har a breakout nice club sandwich here with a piece of lemon cake. Coffee was good too. Will come back for a proper brunch as the food looked great.
its been a while but food just as good as before
lovin it😆, especially 😻their tart …
Love the place, Love the staff! They are so friendly and approachable.
The poached eggs came near fully boiled and was soaked in so much water it left my brioche soggy. Didn’t bother to finish it. Just look at the photo. Decent service though.
Good service  nice food thanks
Came over after dropping by our new house. Excited to have such a nice cafe in this lovely and quiet neighbourhood. Cakes are good and coffee is fragrant!
their coffe and tarts never fail to impress and leaves a lingering feel... 😍  The passionfruit meringue and the lemon tart... no words can describe! They just leaves u thinking pining for them.. wanting to keep returning for MORE!!! …
Good food and drinks. Excellent service even when crowded. Their crossaint and cakes are a must try. Fully packed with quality Ingredients in their pastries. Ambiences is great though could be quite noisy during peak hours.
Came here after hiking. Nice and comfortable cafe. Friendly and efficient staffs. Affordable price. Reasonable waiting time. Will try the pastries next time. …
Pain au chocolat is good, however the reheat doesn&#39;t seems to really warmed the pastry up.
Great place that serve nice croissant! The pastries are awesome. A great place to chill.
Food and ambience was good. Service was decent with friendly staff. It would be a 5-star if the plates (yes physical plates) was slightly larger for a more pleasant dining experience.
Ok. We weren&#39;t here specifically to eat actually, but I always say accidental finds are The Best, and this was one of them. We&#39;d eaten Korean just down the road and the family wanted to chill out someplace. In we went, and it&#39;s like a walk …
I love all things lemon in cakes. But is slightly disappointed by the lemon meringue cake today. The sponge is dry and the fresh cream is not enough to balance the dense cake. A little more trimming of the burn edges of the sponge would …
Desserts were OK (except the French toast - too eggy and had some weird off taste). Mains were meh - you can get your calories elsewhere.
Great coffee &amp; worldclass pastries! Love the easy going ambience and kudos to the dedicated barista n bakers
Insta handle: @foodie.drew Had a mocha and lemon meringue cake. Chill cafe with enough seats to chill on a weekday afternoon with a book. Service staff were also very friendly.
Food was good but expensive. Wait time was the worst, took over two hours to be seated because they missed our group and didn&#39;t bother to even look out of the door where we all were. Would have left if my friends weren&#39;t so insistent on …
It&#39;s been a long while since I visited Carpenter &amp; Cook. They used to have excellent croissants but most of their outlets have closed, except this one near Beauty World. …
A little hidden place which has one of the best pastries that I have ever had. The food and service was good. The mains are alright, but their pastries is definitely worth a try! Oh also try their pulled pork benedict! It&#39;s something different :)
Love the cakes!
Awesome pastries and coffee!
Love the ambience, staff is also friendly with great coffee and pastries/tarts/cakes. They also have a menu for more fuller meals like French toast and eggs benedict. Will definitely come back to try more of their food!😍😍 …
First review of the New Year! Cosy neighbourhood cafe near Beauty World MRT, filled with retro chic antiques - coffee was good though i wish their tarts were a bit bigger! We tried the passionfruit, yuzu and banoffee tarts, and my fave was …
Love the food &amp; pastry, nice environment too~
Glad that they have Oat milk And good coffee
The place is overated in my opinion. Nice decor, ambience and food presentation but the quality of food is not good for such a highly rated cafe. Most of the current google reviews show nice photos of the food but the taste is actually not …
Cozy neighbourhood cafe, located close to many other eateries. It also has a tasteful interior with antiques and dated keepsakes. Hence a perfect setting to relax and simmer down. …
Awesome tarts and good coffee
Nice and quiet place/surrounding .....
Friendly staff. Food and coffee are ok. But not so friendly to the wallet.
Fast service and Delicious baked goods!
One of our favorite cafes in SG. Yummy cakes, bakes and coffee.
Nice food and ambiance
I love their playlist - They play all the good ol&#39; classics! Other than that, iced latte was excellent and the mushroom soup was rich.
Been here twice but each time there&#39;s a supposed queue. Quite disappointing that there&#39;s no system to allow reservations to be made. Business overflowing to the other food outlets nearby. …
This is my third visit. Sad to say but the allure of Carpenter &amp; Cook had diminished over my visits as the limited menu has gotten rather boring. …
Nice food &amp; cosy environment.
Always good to come back for the scones and coffee. Great place to just relax and chill. Service is topnotch and so is the food.
Its good. Ordered the home made basil pasta out of the norms , very garlicky. There&#39;s this lunch set for $21.50 where you will get pasta , coffee ( i got latte) and a mini tart. Mine was a mini lemon tart which the lemon zest was strong but …
It&#39;s a nice and cosy place tucked in a quite corner around Beauty World area. The food is nice especially the Club Sandwich and the Chicken BLT. The French Toast is nice as well but I wished that the maple syrup is served separately instead …
Used to have better service and food, Still recommend it though!
The carbonara was not hot when served and the sauce was a bit watery ::(( i think just go for brunch items and the desserts!!!!!
BEST lemon tart and passion fruit meringue tart. I fell in love with this dessert since trying theirs many years ago. Been to a few other shops over the years, some famous ones too, hoping that I don’t need to travel so far to satisfy my …
Went there early in the morning to get some bite before going to office. Really loved the restaurant set up with lotsa of retro fitting. Staff was friendly. Ordered the pork meat Benedict with homemade cornbread. I will have to say not the …

Moist tasty cakes look no further, carpenter and cook is where you should go. Home of my favourite ANGMO carrot cake 😂, not those in the hawkers. Also, lychee raspberry rose is good too! …
Food is great and staff are friendly. It&#39;s a nice way to spend a Sunday morning with your loved ones. Can be a little pricey though.
Can’t find a place in Singapore with better passionfruit tart than theirs. I’m always here for the tarts, rest of the menu is okay
Beautiful place , great service,  scrumptious dessert
Nice decorations and awesome food too. Will recommend!
Nice cosy place with good pastries and cakes
One of the best cakes I&#39;ve ever tasted!! Nice coffee too. Quiet place to chill out with friends and family.
Best cakes/pastries in Beauty world.
Reasonable joint. Slight pricey.
Ordered eggs benny but one was overcooked. Coffee is just okay. There are better brunch places nearby.
They have a weekday luch promo set that comes with main + mini tart + coffee/tea/hot cocoa at $21. Recommend pulled pork egg benedicts. Love the croissants, tarts, cakes as well.
Went there for brunch, and pasta, potato waffles and crab cake were not available (bummer). We enjoyed the service and food nonetheless. BLT was packed with chicken breast, and I like the croissant. Poached eggs can be improved as texture …
A really cozy place with nice decor. The quiche and latte were good:D
Came here for a late weekday lunch at about 3-4pm, the place was relatively empty. Decided to go for the set lunch ($21) that comes with a coffee and a mini tart. The chicken pasta was delicious. Coffee was also good, but the chocolate sea …
Have been a fan of C&amp;C since 2012! I would give 6 stars if I could! Props to the Best Baker of the Year 🌟 …
Newly found haven for my cake n latte satisfaction. Only concern is parking lot and seats availability.
Always crowded on a weekend and have to wait 30mins-1hour. That&#39;s understandable, but staff should not commit to call you back when you are on the waiting list when in fact they don&#39;t call you back at all. Wasted more than 40mins of our time waiting for a call that never came and we had to settle for food elsewhere... -.-.
Excellent pastry.
Friendly service, good coffee and decent food. Slightly pricey for a neighborhood coffee but I will come back.
Good pastries and nice ambience for chilling out~
This is a small cafe filled with antiques, in a quiet neighborhood, . Went in for desserts. Lovely little tarts!
Nice deco and Nice Food too.  The dessert selections is good.  Worth the visit, but price is on the high side.
Nostalgic ambience
The food is delicious and the antique atmosph …
Nice ambiance
Serve nice cake and good coffee but note that they close at 9pm even on weekend
Feels like I got transported back in time~!!
Bitter sharpness coffee. Tiramisu cake is having too much cream
Wild Mushroom Soup is delicious! Thick and creamy, filled with mushroom bits. It comes with a portion of bread crumbs that goes well together. ($6.5) …
Nice and quaint cafe with a focus on antique and retro decor. Food wise, cafe food with many baked goods both savoury and sweet. Coffee is roasted by Liberty Coffee (custom blend). Mains are $15-$20 and service is good. Friendly staff who are attentive as well. Definitely a place to meet for coffee and their baked goods.
Alot of of antiqies sprawled throughout!

Love the eggs benedict. Awesome deal w entertainer 1-for-1. However, one of the waitresses is rather rude. I missed their phone call when they wanted to inform me that my table was ready, I rushed over within two minutes of the call and she …
love the interior !!! went during CB period, &amp; had a croissant and matcha latte to go. v helpful and friendly staffs. they have p good croissants (7/10) but i still prefer tiong bahru bakery (9/10). and as for their matcha latte (4/10), i wouldn’t order it again.
Simple deco in a nostalgic design. Good for brunch. Drink is acceptable. The selling point is food and pastries.
Nice coffee with carrot cakes
The coffee here was so amazing that I had to go for a 2nd cup! Friendly staff as well :) the air conditioning was very weak at my seat so come here on a day where it&#39;s not that warm!
Great customer service! The staffs are very friendly and food is great!  After finishing our lunch there, my friend went to the counter to order a cake …
Friendly staff, good ambience.
Ample seating. Very friendly and warm service. I must say their coffee is one of the smoothest I&#39;ve had. Tiramisu was OK, that&#39;s because I must prefer stronger alcohol in it. Pistachio raspberry cake was a new flavour... Not bad but I&#39;m a …
At this weather aircon is not working and they receive customers !!
Good coffee. Good cake. 👍🏻 …
Delicious rose cake! I loved it, moist and not too sweet! And I like the atmosphère and deco, reminded me of those bistro cafe in Paris :) vintage lovers, to love
A nice place to have a coffee to chill and relax with friends at this cafe late afternoon. 👍🏻Came across a an attractive lady with a white top. Haha😂 …
Very nice service and vintage decoration! Good food as well! Must try pulled pork egg Benedict!
Good generous portions of pork in the pork ragout pasta, nice ambience and friendly staff. The croissant for the eggs Benedict was fresh as well. Nice brunch place.
The service staff were fantastic, the decor is very pretty and the food was decent! Went there on a PH and there was no pasta avail tho :(
Good food...v friendly server
No service charge! pocket friendly.
Not my first time here. Love their traditional decorations. A nice instagramable place that worth to visit. They have limited choices for brunch but it’s good enough as you can see their crowds especially during breakfast time on weekends. They serves generous portion of foods that priced at $17nett.
Nice coffee and cakes
Kinda cold so bring a jacket if you want to order cold drinks (But also very refreshing because it&#39;s a moderately long and hot walk from Beauty World MRT station.) The staff is very nice friendly, and patient. …
Too many visitor, so can&#39;t seat long for chitchat
Food is OK but price on high side. The most unacceptable is paying 30cents for a tiny cup of ice water (tap water)which is slightly more than a bottle of vitagen and is not refillable. Will not come again due to such service..
I had the Lemon Merengue Pie and a Cafe Latte. Really enjoyed both.
Very lemony
Very cosy vintage cafe located at Beauty World. Order their pulled pork egg benedict, which was pretty not bad. They have a range of pastry made in house, I&#39;ve tried their cinnamon roll, it&#39;s so crispy outside and soft on the inside, really worth a try if you are a cinnamon fan!
Quiet ambience and good desserts
Nice food. A little pricy.
Totally enjoy the raspberry rose cake here.
After I ordered my hot coffee and drove off, Paid $5.20 for coffee that turned out to be warm.
A famous cafe with good ambiance, be prepared to spend some money because it is a little bit expensive. Recommended: lemon meringue or passion fruit meringue tart
Friendly service!
Love the chocolate fudge cake!!
Great coffee from Liberty Coffee Roasters. And excellent pastries. The Apple crumble was delicious. Great cafe to relax.
Won&#39;t travel for this but if I&#39;m in the area I&#39;d definitely have some
Service and food wasnt great. Good ambience and pastries were decent.
The food is nice but very long wait
Yummy cakes :) my favourite is the lemon meringue cake - tangy &amp; just the right amount of sweetness ~
Delightful place to get ur Dessert n coffee fixed. Nice Unique Decor of this awesome place, its special and cosy due to the different furniture they had unlike most other cafe with standard tables n chairs. …
I love the coffee here. There is something about the coffee here. I do not know how they make it but it is amazing. Maybe I had a very good batch. I have only been to carpenter and cook once but looking forward to having the coffee again. Hope it will be just as good.
A decent cafe with a spacious interior. Very poor air conditioning and restricted usage of plugs. The mocha latte I had was barely passable. A good place to bring your friends who can’t tell a cup of decent coffee from a Starbucks frappe. Strongly not recommended for students looking to study here. Staff is quite friendly though!
Food was good, ordered the salmon with eggs benedict 😊 (though waiting time is quite long, 20-30min) …
Just about ok. Coffee served lukewarm. Remember to ask for it hot! Food took 30mins to arrive. Not allowed to swap one type of toast on the menu for another type of toast on the menu, that&#39;s too difficult apparently. Basically go somewhere else.
Nice and chill place with tasty deserts and antiques for sale and decor
Good
I love this cafe but it&#39;s ashamed that it&#39;s near closing time when we reached. They didn&#39;t chase us out when we reached the cafe. Great customer service. I love the smell of the coffee brewing inside the cafe, reminded me of the cafe I used to visit when I was studying in Sydney, Australia. I will visit again soon.
The slices of cake ar …
Decent food at very reasonable price. Chic environment with antiques inside the cafe. Enjoy a cuppa and have a go at the swing outside.
A quiet place for meet ups, serving deserts and a reasonable cuppa coffee! They do serve up decent desserts and pastries  till late at night. Parking can be tough during weekends and after office hours as its free in the evening (curbside parking).
Service was fantastic! Food was delicious!!
Food: 9/10 I really liked the smoked salmon egg Benedict. What really tipped the scales for me was the inclusion of croissant as a bread base …
Big fan of their pastries and cakes but not their main courses.
Small cozy cafe located at a quiet corner about 5mins walk away from beauty world MRT. Served a wide varieties of freshly handmade pastries and standard brunch menus like egg benedict and waffles. …
This is our local cafe. With excellent green salads , quiche&#39;s . Thankfully not very crowded. Reasonably priced and good service.
The Tiramusu was amazing, one of the better ones i have had. Comfortable place to hang out with friends
The lemon cake never fails to delight me. Always enjoy a cup of coffee with the lemon cake here.
Love the Flat White and the Pastries
Great ambience
Nice &amp; cosy. The high ceiling and spacious seatings make everyone feel at ease, including the children.
Was a little stuffy inside. Liked the vintage theme of the place. Pricing was drinks and food was ok. Would come again.
Very quaint and cosy cafe. The pulled pork eggs benedict was yummy. No sockets available so come with your laptop fully charged. There is free wifi however.
Cozy and nice decorations. Food is good. Coffee and dessert is great. All looks very yummy.
Cake is soooo good
I love their coffee and deserts! Great atmosphere to chill and hangout. Aesthetics of this place is on point. I recommend their chocolate sea salt tart because it’s reallyyy gooooooood
Yummy brunch!
Food was good. The atmosphere is great. Feels like in one of those homey type of coffee shops, i.e. not Starbucks type. But the acoustics of the place was bad. Instead of feeling relaxed, I get bothered by the noise.
Great food and drink..warm atmophere and friendly staff...
First time here and I am not disappointed! Walking in, it’s like I’ve been transported back to the bakeries in Sydney, where a smorgasbord of fresh bakes lining the counter immediately catches your eye. All the pastries looked sooo good …
Carpenter &amp; Cook is within our neighborhood so we have frequent this quirky and cute cafe often. Their desserts are delectable especially their chocolate sea salt tart, passionfruit meringue tart, and earl grey lavender cake. However, they …
Terrible coffee
Nice pastries!serving in small batches and always fresh.great ambience too!
the coffee had no taste. went on saturday morning and the wait time for food and coffee was at least 20mins. the place was at full capacity.
Place bit noisy and coffee so so...
Tried their almond croissant , it&#39;s crust is not crispy. Many better one out there.

Good decent cafe, with well brewed coffee.  Would recommend
Was surprised for the first visit, find its deco concept with old furniture and items was special, by the 2nd, 3rd visit, the novelty wore off. The beverages and desserts are a bit pricey.
Great place for coffee and mini tarts
One of my fav cafe! I love the lemon drizzle cakeeeee so much
Nice quiet place for a coffee.. Nice old school decor with intricate details
Went here for a good brunch. Food is nice and the staff are very friendly. Recommended!
Food was alright but for that price point.... I&#39;m pretty sure there are much better alternatives. Also, I was very confused at their cutlery specifically the spoons. They were clean but for some reason they seemed to be going for the Hygiene rating C kinda vibe
love the olden days ambience
Cozy and good atmosph …
Nice food here and friendly staff. Before ordering from the menu, u suggest that you take a look at what they have to offer at the counter first, some times they have quite some nice cold fish like salads and sandwiches, they you may prefer over their house menu.
Decent place, food and ambience.
Nice place. Motorcycle lover or wheels lover place. Price a bit expensive
A little inaccessible but love their tiramisu!
Perfect brunch spot with a great crew!
Nice cozy place to chill on a lazy weekday morning with a yummy sumptuous brunch. Around $22 for a main/pasta + mini tart + coffee/tea set. 👍 …
A bit pricey but great ambience and good tea.
Decided to try the brunch at Carpenter and Cook. Ordered the smoked salmon egg benedict and a club sandwich. The service crew were nice to offer us 3 free tarts complimentary on the house as our food was …
Pretty good fruit tart and chocolate caramel tart, lay back environment and nice deco which I quite enjoy, a nice relaxing quiet place to chat after a short hike in Bukit Timah.
I preferred this place when it was less sanitised!
Charming cafe, good for coffee, cakes and some brunch items.

The ham and cheeese croissant with hot latte  makes a powerpack combo 😄 …
Awesome stuff here
Tarts are YYUUUMM!!!! Smoothie not bad too. But really small variety of food and food only served til early afternoon :(
Came here for brunch. Always love this place as it is cozy.  Today I had the Thick Cut Brioche French Toast lunch set. It comes with a …
A bit depressing.. the eggs were salty. The coffee is tasteless
I&#39;m coming again. Great for a relaxing Sunday brunch with friends and family. Laidback atmosphere with plenty of antique artefacts like old typewriters, suitcases and lamps for decor. Food was really good without feeling too over-the-top …
Uh. Dont try the egg benedict with pulled pork on cornbread thats all im saying. The ham and cheese croissant is not bad though.
Best pastries in town!
I was terribly hungry mid morning, so I dropped in this lovely cafe.  I ordered a smoked salmon quiche AND a ham and cheese croissant, along with an iced latte.  Everything was excellent.  The service was prompt, the place very clean and …
Impromptu trip to the cafe. Heard of it years ago but only went there just yesterday. Tried their drinks, mains and a slice of cakes. Hot chocolate was alright, nothing much to compliment about. …
A cafe with a lot of heritage fell in the decorations, nice cake and drink too!!!
Quite a good bakery and brunch place (weekends only) near to Beauty World station in Bukit Timah. The dishes themselves are tasty and value for money, but the downside is that the menu itself is small. There is no GST and service charge, …
The croissant sandwiches are not bad and the coffee is really good but pretty damn expensive. They&#39;re also serving a bunch of pastries and cakes which look and taste decent but way too sweet and unhealthy for my taste. It&#39;s a nicely …
Loving the atmosphere of this cafe, very charming and vintage looking. Coffee was also not bad with some selection of cakes and pastries.
Peaceful for a week day afternoon
Good coffee and cozy ambience 👍 …
Had the Club Sandwich (about SGD16) and Croque Monsieur. The food was really good. Service was alright. Croque Monsieur was a bit salty but the taste was really flavourful. Price is affordable esp with The Entertainer app. Parking available along the roadside and there&#39;s a public carpark about 3 mins walk also.
Nice cafe a quiet place to hangout with friends and have a long chat 🙂🙂 …
Nice cafe to dine in and slow down time
Good coffee/pastries and nice ambience, but they really could bring in cashless payments - Visa/paywave or even Grabpay. …
Decent coffee. But what will stand out is the ambience of the place. old rustic laid back interiors and friendly staff. Breads and cakes are out of the world.
Good cafe, quiet
Cozy vintage themed café with an outdoor swing! Tucked away in the residential neighbourhood of Lorong Kilat. The relaxed ambiance of the Carpenter &amp; Cook makes it a very a warm and inviting place to hangout at. The great thing about this …
Milk shake was very nice. Waffers too. Just a little pricey
Hidden cafe next to one of my favorite Korean restaurants ^_^
Nice coszy place for some good English breakfast and coffee. Good spread of choices. Place is decorated with many old stuffs from yesteryears. Good for family or friends gatherings.

I find their ABC juice quite refreshing. However, I don&#39;t really like their earl grey coconut cake as it is too sweet.

Good service. Excellent lemon meringue cake. And not expensive -- bonus.
Relaxing atmosphere here, highly recommend passion fruit maringue tard!
Lemon tart is good &amp; refreshing yums!
the Elderflower Lemon Cake was very good, dense and moist cake with intense flower fragrance.
A great place to grab a brunch after a hike at the Bukit Timah Nature reserve. Loved the vintage set up.
Great coffee and dessert. The meringue tarts are awesome!
Probably one of the best Carrot cake in sg
A vintage home store and cafe, selling carefully curated furniture, home decor, fresh home-made baked goods and confectionery. They also provide dessert tables, styling services, vintage props and decor for weddings, parties, photoshoots …
Nice place, food is really nice, one of the best i had,things are a bit too salty the pulled pork was very salty and the sandwich tgt with the ham and cheese cause the sandwich to be very salty.
Good for dating and gathering
Their cakes are just as good as always. Shame the acoustics inside the shop is quite bad though, quite noisy with a large crowd...
Food is ok ok. Atmosphere not bad.
Nice vibe for coffee and cake.
Good variety of cakes and baked goods. Mini tarts are slightly expensive at $3+ each (3 for $9). Coffee was decent. Nice place for a post dinner coffee. This cafe is on the Entertainer app.
Nice brunch place
nice place for breakfast. the decoration of the shop is lovely and the bread &amp; cake is prepared nicely. the cheese bread is very recommended. …

Yummy cakes, quaint ambience and decoration. Coffee is fairly decent too.  Good for a quiet afternoon. …
Nice place, good food. Hard to find a parking spot though.
Nice bakery. potato waffle is really great. But the signature sandwich seems a bit too safe and nothing particular. overall, quite good.
Informal atmosphere amongst antiques, friendly staff and wholesome food, but only accepts cash &amp; NETS
Nice vintage decor ( serious retro display). The whole Lorong Kilat has 5 other cafes. The food is nice but I saw the brunch menu is far better.
Decent coffee with quaint and eccletic furniture
Pastries here are quite good!
Nice place with a cosy atmosphere to have coffee.
Great service, good recovery! They initially mixed up our dishes, but immediately came to apologise and replaced our dishes, and gave us some desserts on the house.
Nice place to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and the staff are very delighted to serve you. Will go back there again. Cheers
Really nice texture and taste for both cakes I tried here
Quiet and friendly place!
Nice service
Great quality food and beverage! Kids friendly but I couldn’t find the diaper change at washroom. The staffs are very friendly and polite!:) …
We always wanted to visit this cafe because of the nice photos of this place we saw online. Overall it is a vintage place, but the food is so so only. …
Drinks and ambience are great, but it would be nice to enjoy the drink in a proper glass rather than a plastic cup.
Pastries are very good.
Don’t expect too much for service provided.
Pastry always looks so good here. Thank goodness I live no where close to this place or I&#39;ll be here every day. Love their passionfruit meringue tart and I see that they&#39;ve introduced new items to their menu. All looking good!
Hidden in the quiet Lor Kilat. Enjoy a good cuppa coffee and delightful desserts at this quaint cafe.
Original deco, cozy, quiet, good granola with Greek yogurt, good service
Probably because I love vintage items, the moment I stepped into the cafe, I fell in love with it. The food presentation was beautiful with the use of those vintage English plates. The food that I had tasted great. A wonderful place for a afternoon tea, brunch, lunch &amp; dinner. Service was good too.
The egg Ben, pull pork sandwiches on corn bread is amazing
Nice ambience..retro n chic. Lemon tart superb!!
It&#39;s a whimsical cafe with a swing outdoor. Feels like someone&#39;s kitchens or dining table from the 80s.  Their cakes are fantastic and they are on entertainer app 1-4-1. Walking distance from Beauty world station. Recommend strawberry …
Nice little cafe with great ambience and pastries. Luv the banofi and lemon drizzle.
Ambience and deco were pleasant. We ordered the  Lemon meringue cake, Ice chocolate and Sea salt salted caramel frappe. The cake was not bad.
Wonderful place with nice brunch options. Very cool ambience with lots of antique stuff around. Good for Saturday brunches.
Coffee is nice
Have not come to Carpenters and cook in a long while. Coffee and pastries are nice and the place seems to have gone through some refurbishment with more seats and ample space.
Went on a Saturday morning and as it wasnt very crowded, i was able to have a good comfortable conversation with my friend:) Staff members are really nice and friendly and the tarts are absolutely delightful! Coffee smelt and tasted great too:)
I like the coffee here, good rustic atmosphere but the furniture may look too old for some. There&#39;s the afternoon crowd even on weekdays so if you&#39;re planning on doing work here, come after the lunch hour. However, they don&#39;t accept contactless payment here so you have to bring your physical wallet.
Delicious
Great skinny flat white with a smokey flavour. Nice ambience, friendly crew but do expect a crowd during meal hours.
Cozy café with super awesome sweets. I luv the Yuzu cheesecake and Cinnamon Roll here.
It seems to be always crowded and you may have to wait for a table. It’s worth coming here for the desserts and smoothies, the main dishes fell short of expectations. The chocolate sea salt caramel tart is my favorite and so indulgent.
Nice matcha!
Nice ambience and coffee, but prices are slightly on the high side for food.
retro styled with tasty pastry
Good coffee, good food.
One of the finest coffee places in Singapore
Cool Ambience, plenty of antiques, great staff, great tarts and pastries!
Cost cafe servin deli food
Staff were friendly, ambience was good but latte and merry trio latte were so-so only.
Cosy place with antiques and good coffee and pastries
Entertained by Antique Stuff
Great food and ambience!!!😉😄 …
Hands down the tastiest yuzu cake ever, but it&#39;s pretty costly. Nonetheless, it&#39;s definitely worth the try!
Cakes taste hard, like they have been left out for long time. Coffee so so. Used to be better.
Attentive staff, great cakes and drinks selection. Love it!
A cozy place to go with friends and family. Good service, good food.
Retro cafe with good ambience; nice food.
The ambiance is good; filled with retro-wares, friendly staff, tables with sewing machine legs! Pastries are intricately prepared. Coffee reminds me of Italy. Overall, a good place to come back again and again.
Nice ambience for pastries and drinks.
Nice ambience
Great coffee...and delicious fresh pastry...nice ambiance...great customer service...
Great service and nice variety of cakes
The best tarts in Singapore!
They serve very nice and healthy food.
Nice place with good cosy environment. Good for chilling
Food made and served with love. Service is friendly, and the place is not crowded. Good ambience and would definitely come here to relax. Flat white is good.
Nice ambience, comfortable seats. Iced Latte is smooth. Not many people, good to chill out
Nice and good selection of desserts, pastries and coffee. Cozy ambience and friendly staff
Friendly and cosy
Quite terrible coffee and croissants, very stingy on wifi. Only the interior decor and good service are its saving graces
a good place to chill. Do take note that the space is small and seats are limited. Serves drinks / small bites only!
Good cafe with interesting decoration.Here  u can find tasty bakery and drink.My fav is passionfruit tart.
It&#39;s all about the ambience. Really cosy feel. Food is decent, but on the pricey side.
Loved the furniture. Decent baked goods. Coffee could have a bit more of a kick.
Nice place to chill. No GST and service charge. So expect to serve yourself and enjoy the atmosphere. Lighting is dark for reading. Good for chatting.
Great coffee and pastry. Relaxing ambient too.
Great coffee and pastries
Delicious tarts and cakes. Very interesting decor and (almost) everything is for sale!
Nice place to chill out and chit chat with friends in the evening. Serves nice coffee, teas pastries and craft beers too
Good options
Love how heritage and antique themed this cafe is.. A great place to chill~
The tarts here are the real highlight.
Relaxed ambience. No harm trying.
Great place to chill and hangout. Love the vibe at night.
Nice place to have a coffee to relax. Not too crowded with unique mix of tables and chairs.
Cosy setting with good coffee
Cozy environment loved their salmon.
Lovely place with a nice selection of tarts, pastries and drinks. Some of the vintage furniture at Carpenter &amp; Cook that are being displayed on their shelves and even the dining tables can be purchased if they suit your fancy.
Nice retro ambience cafe.
There weren&#39;t sufficient seats and many of the foods were sold out. The sandwiches were not warmed up enough and the coffee was mild.
Great little place. Whether you want a simple coffee, an indulgent cake or something more filling they have you covered. Friendly staff, good prices. …
Love their foods!!
As a former T2 Diabetic I am still looking for Low GI bakes and cakes! Sad to see that advanced and usually food savvy Singapore is failing here big time. Cosy place. Americano too small and a bit sour. Not sure what beans they use but it …
The place was very crowded we found it difficult to seat our party of 6. Good service staff saves it.
Eating 4 cos of the nice ambience. Cosy, relaxing, would come here more often if it wasn&#39;t so pricey.
Nice ambience and food
Good ambiance, a good choice for &#34;me-time&#34;. If only there&#39;s Wifi provided, everything will be perfect!
Great for lounging. The cookies - especially the sea salt/chocolate and lavender ones - are delish
Nice pastries!  No wifi provided thou! Limited charging sockets
Great quality pastry and nice atmosphere.food is a little on the expensive side
Great place
Nice ambience but quality of the food can be hit or miss
Good coffee and pastries/baked goods. I was here on a busy weekend afternoon but service was good so it wasn&#39;t a long wait. If you&#39;re in a big group it might be difficult to get seats.
Nice ambience with lots of antiques everywhere.  We had carrot cake (still cannot beat the carrot cake at Holland V pancake …
Outstanding place to chill and do some work with good coffee. Could be better with wifi but well....
The few cafes that open on Monday.  It was nice and quiet when we were there.
Tucked away hidden in the residential recessed of Jalan kilt , just off Upper Bukit Timah road. Quaint dual purpose shop that serves both cafe and retro furniture/curio shop. Coffee here is good, and they have a great lemon tart. Nice and …
I love the ambience and if you have time to chat with the lady owners, hear their stories of flea market shopping in the European isles! Although tucked away in a nondescript corner, patrons seem to come from afar so they seem to have a …
Nice decor, I like the records on the back wall.   Cakes were nice, I really liked the carrot cake. Coffee was okay,pretty good. Good beans and good temperature but I don&#39;t think the milk they used was great. It definitely wasn&#39;t very creamy, textured milk.
Passionfruit tart was good but prices. Tea&#39;s not nice at all
Nice pastries, decent coffee and ambience. Great service from the staff here..
I gave it 4 stars out of 5 for overall experience: as the staff heated up our pastries without being told. So that was nice. …
Well known for their signature Passionfruit Meringue Tart !
Vintage Cafe, serve somewhat good pastries
Desserts are a tad pricey; would recommend the sea salt chocolate tart. Located about 15 mins walk from beauty world mrt station.
Young people&#39;s favorite place. Chill with good desserts
With its eclectic decor, you may want to bring home more than the delectable spread of fresh bakes and coffee, maybe a chair or even a table (with a price of course) home? …
Had a Cinnamon Roll for dessert after a hearty dinner... wow, it was warm, sweet and flaky! Pairing it with a hot cuppa and a buddy to enjoy with, this Wednesday evening cannot get any better. Beautiful and cosy interior that had us lingering for hours!
A chill cafe with above average coffee and dessert.
I like the place ambiance!
Nice ambient with antique furnitures. Good coffee together with hearty bakeries. Try their croissants!
Really like the decorations used here, which can be very vintage and well placed. Cakes are pretty good too, but for the entire experience, can be slightly pricey for a teatime / breakfast indulgence.
I like the quiet environment, tucked away on Lor Kilat. The decor&#39;s fun and quirky and lend itself very well to an afternoon of reading. Those looking for heavy meals need to be warned that they serve only cakes and pastries.
Very cosy and laid back place. Good for a weekend chill out spot
Nice cakes
Very cozy cafe that&#39;s popular with photographers and wannabes. Goes with an antique goods kinda theme, so you&#39;ll see old typewriters and decorations around. Cakes and coffee are pretty decent but on the pricier end. The mont blanc tart is pretty good :)
Cosy cafe, wonderful coffee and pastries. Warm friendly staff. A great place to chill and catch up with friends.
Nice pastries for breakfast and always really friendly
Nice little coffee shop that also sells vintage furniture. No wifi
Wow! Totally in love with it. Brownie is a must try.
Lovely vintage ambience
Great place to have a cup of coffee and a piece of pie in a vintage ambience.
Poor attitude towards customers and disorganized staff. Absolutely disappointing.
A nice, quaint cafe conveniently tucked opposite Beauty World Plaza. The decor is one of years gone by, with a vintage layout that is a refreshing change from the template bakery cafes of today. …
Went here for brunch and it was good! Gonna visit again and to try their orange juice and another menu…
We were going to order and they told us that it took more than an hour to serve. Over an hour for an egg sandwich ???
Poor queue management, bad dining experience for the price. Not worth imo
Told us the order will 30 minutes only after we paid. Made us wait 40 mins.
Food preparation takes way too long. Pricey.
For those who love eggs &amp; and burgers. Our most regular orders are Fairfax, Cheese Burgers, and Bacon, cheese &amp; eggs. If you&#39;re having two of the latter ones, the eggs are slightly runny, so your …
First time dining there and it was a horrible experience. The food was good but let down by the very poor service. It was a weekday lunch and it was not crowded at 1pm. …
Been going back quite often. Good. Sandwiches are super tasty.  Highly recommended!
The price is too expensive for the food and drinks that they served. Nothing special or uniqueness in their sandwiches or burgers that at least can justify the price. The sandwich is just like a normal bread with bacon &amp; egg. Don&#39;t even have condiments served.
I&#39;m not a huge fan of runny eggs, and it seems no other option is available here other than certain sandwiches with scrambled eggs. The flavor of their sandwiches was good. They won&#39;t deconstruct a sandwich for a picky child, and since the …
Overhyped egg sandwich..not value for money and waste of more than 1 hr in queue..
The taste is okay and the port …
The ambience is nice but other than that the food was just alright! Nothing fantastic about food.
Food is OK only. Price is expensive. Nice environment.
Takes a while for the food to be ready, nice scrambled eggs. The brioche bun felt a little dry as compared to other brioche buns. Not sure if it was a little stale, or if the buns are this way to maintain their shape and not absorb too much scrambled eggs.
Not sure what all the hype was about.  The egg wasn&#39;t even fully cooked.  The drinks are pretty good tho.  Likely won&#39;t come back.
Basically egg burgers, not too many options for people who want healthy options.
Overall experience not bad. Food is good. But personally find it abit overprice.
Great place to dine. Food was great and staff were phenomenal!
Interesting scramble egg burger but with premium pricing. Prime.location affect premium price.
Came just before lunch hour at 1120am. Had to wait more than 45mins for my takeaway to be ready. Will never come back. Much better and quicker options out there.
Eggslut is not just like other burger concept it&#39;s inspired love for eggs... Menu is balance of comfort delicious it&#39;s is more than just a meals.
Had lunch so only have their promotional dessert and craft soda. V nice
Headed here as not many other nearby places were open over CNY. We had the Fairfax and the bacon burger and truffle hash browns - the eggs were all smooth, buttery, and slippery, sounds unappetising but they were good. Other than that, …
DONT BUY ANYT OTHER THAN THE BURGERS
Good food and service had the cheesburger and it was good
The foods bland but decently photogenic, they scrimp on everything and the price is expensive and not at all value for money. The cost is extremely inflated by the location. Its worse than McDonald&#39;s so take that for what you will.
Awesome burgers and atmosphere. Foods and atmosphere are great, price is fine, only thing I complain is the service time was so long. I waited around 20-30 mins when the place felt not too crowded.
Eggslut was one of the hottest new franchise chain restaurant in Singapore, when it was opened last year. When it first opened, there were ridiculously rows of long queue. Now, the hype is over, you can pretty much can get a seat quite …
Nice fluffy eggs 🥚! Fairfax for the win! …
We were there on a saturday afternoon for lunch. Service was fast. Omlette burger was yummy but it gets a little too much by the last few bits. …
To sum it all up, it&#39;s an overpriced fairly delicious omelette burger lol.
The store is clean, the food is okay
Good taste, first time to eat Eggslut with friend. Good place to stay together.
Visited today at lunch time - there was no crowd and service was prompt. The restaurant was clean and had good seats for people watching. Ordered the bacon and egg sandwich and enjoyed it, just wished there’s lesser ketchup - I find the …
I was given a voucher to claim my free orange juice in mid January 23. Today, I tried with the promocode given and it didn’t work. Asked the counter at Suntec City, the manager told me it’s expired. However, on the voucher given , there was …
Very average food that I can make myself.
Buns were barely warm and sausage buger was too salty including the hashbrown. Totally not worth the trip. Mcdonalds tasted better
Attracted by its name and recalled this is a popular outlet in Japan.  Ordered a Fairfax which comes in a toasted bun with creamy scramble eggs, caramelized onion with cheese.  It’s an amazing experience for egg lover despite the price is on a steep side.
Decent albeit overpriced sandwiches. Tried their Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. The sandwich is pretty big in size and taste pretty good. But for $12 per sandwich, it&#39;s kinda hard to swallow. …
Wasn&#39;t crowded when I went maybe because it was drizzling and there is a short part of the route that is not sheltered. Food is ok wouldn&#39;t go again. Just to try out. Interesting flavours but the truffle hashbrowns were really good but a bit more on the pricey side. Overall, a good place to go on a date to check out the food.
Dine-in. The Fairfax scrambled eggs were not runny enough and filling was lacking. The bacon and egg burgers definately not worth 12 dollars it felt like something …
Food was not excellent, but better than average for a &#34;western&#34; breakfast. Would prefer latte over drip coffee.
Staff are friendly and helpful.  Food is nice, especially the burger.
I can hardly give even a 3/5 for this place. Over priced food and beverage. 15 minutes for simple orders to arrive. Yes it&#39;s a rainy day but there are perhaps equal amount of service staff versus customers. The food is salty. The burger …
I came to try the Fairfax burger for the first time as a local and found it to be too greasy and jelak for my liking. Its like the whole burger was greased in butter, maybe it&#39;s nice for some people but not for me. For the price of $12 for …
$12 for an egg burger I think too overprice. Just curious coz its just opposite our hotel. The egg is nice actually but I dont think its worth it for such price as the bun not as special as I feel.
I didn&#39;t know eggs were so delicious.  …
Food was great but service needs to be improved.  I left my sandwich on the table half eaten n drinking water, then the auntie came and asked can clear or not?  I havent even finished my food, just stopped to drink water only.
Main door and queue for ordering is along Scotts Road. There is also a &#39;back door&#39; entrance from the Scott Plaza mall side. It gets busy during the main brunch time so I suggest you come at the opening hour for breakfast. They do have …
I love the food here! Bacon is crispy &amp; the burgers are just yummy!
zzzzz, this is quite bad. oily and none of the food and drinks are good. please avoid and spend your money at other burger joint
Very impressed by the wagyu burger and fairfax scrambled eggs burger. The hash brown is also a must try, pretty unique. OJ is not freshly squeezed tho.
Surprisingly good food in a place with a very peculiar name. The Fairfax is the signature here, a stacked sandwich on a light brioche with 3 scrambled eggs, loads of cheddar and a somewhat bland Chipotle dressing. The eggs were fluffy, …
egg”slutty” indeed - but slightly overpriced.  Good cold brew!
Visited during weekday morning. There was no physical queue but an invisible queue cause of the grab orders. …
Had bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, side salad and a craft soda drink. For the sandwich, bacon is nicely done and is crispy; buns were moist but I couldn&#39;t really taste the egg. Overall I would come back for the burger again. Side salad is …

The Fairfax Sandwich comes with a description of “cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun“. If you’re dining at Eggslut, you definitely CANNOT miss the Fairfax Sandwich. …
Love the scrambled eggs
I thought the burger is nice but it was not “wow” at all!
The truffle hasbrowns were a delight and highly recommend trying the original Eggslut. They also had a little merch station which was super cute.
I dont know but me like the burger better, anyway good place to have breakfast in the morning :)
Go for the Fairfax! It&#39;s egglilicious!
Nice sandwiches order fairfax and bacon ,egg
Great place to hangout, even not much various kind of menu
So they said Gaucho is their specialty burger at $27, and she asked - would you like to add $1.50 to scramble egg? Any Avocado to add… not a big eater, I replied no need. …
Overpriced and so-so taste but i loved her fresh orange juice tho
Love the cheese burger
Fairfax sandwich, hash brown, panna cotta
Expensive
The bacon-egg-cheese is basically a bougie version of the McDonalds bacon egg mcmuffin - so, obviously, I love it. On my “healthier” days here, I go for the double cheeseburger but change my buns to a salad. Their truffle hash browns slap …
So underwhelmed.  Had never tried so went to see what the hype was about. Had a bacon, egg and …
Their scrambled egg is goooooood
good eggs but tbf eggs are eggs its nothing unbelievably incredible but id say the food is pretty good. in addition the time waiting for food was rather short as the food is almost always ready in 5 mins. all in all a pretty great place to eat at!
I was one of the few people out there who haven&#39;t tried eggslut. Thought it would be like the best thing I had ever placed in my mouth. But after putting it in my mouth,savouring it, it was nothing but a classy Macdonald&#39;s outlet. No doubt …
Tried today after hearing so many people queuing for it when it’s first open… Nothing fantastic to me just so so…. Don’t think will give 2nd chance
Nice service, bun is soft &amp; bouncy, while the egg is so creamy &amp; puffy, The orange juice is fresh &amp; not sweet, definitely a favorite The space is clean &amp; they have a hand washing machine
Verdict: worth the money. Runny scrambled eggs and I think they add good quality butter and creme fraiche to it. The brioche is soft enough too. Truffle hash is nice and crisp and soft inside. …
Try it without queuing, it&#39;s delicious …
Tasty sandwiches and burgers. Worth the money: certainly ingredients and taste exceed most comparable cafés and fast casual standards like shake shack by far. Sides are alright. Space looks sleek but is not the most comfortable (think: …
Soft texture and juicy 🍔 …
Delicious egg sandwiches and the truffle hash browns are really good
Atrocious service that can rival Karen&#39;s diner. First, they cant help to cut a sandwich into two, then they make u walk twice to collect ur food n drink like they cant coordinate and assemble a simple order together, then they demand u to …
Brioche buns are soft and scrambled eggs are nice. onions are a good add on Coffee is average and I think slightly over priced.
Having dinner here and J3 recommended good food for us and excellent service. Good to be here.
I like J3 good service and nice food . Good recommendations for food.
Beef burgers were fantastic.
Expensive than your typical egg bun and burger but was good and filling. Eggs were fluffy and juicy. Patty was savoury. Buns were soft. I went insane for the truffle hashbrowns. I didn&#39;t even take a photo, they went straight to my mouth! 😂 …
Tasted as good as the Tokyo branch. The best egg sandwich, Fairfax Sandwich
It&#39;s. The school holidays and since we were so impressed by your semi elderly cashier  the last time we were here, my wife and I decided to bring our kids as we were planning to enjoy the orchard Xmas lighting. …

I was waiting till the hype and the queues were gone to try it out. Surprised it doesn&#39;t score at least a 4 in Google. The ambience was great - modernist, large windows, giant fun motifs, the food was so-so, doable at home; the &#34;I can&#39;t be …

Great runny Fairfax sandwich
Their sandwiches are tasty.
Mostly so busy with the shop, alway can see long queue especially from the lunch to dinner. They are working from 8:00am and not too busy like afternoon. Try to visit there. It was good egg cuisine for my breakfast.
very yummy and delicious for their specialty. the baguette is very thin and it is delicious to dip and eat (fancy way to eat). portion may not be favourable for big eater. tried the bacon, egg and cheese on the brioche. something i will come back for.
The food in the store is very delicious, the shape is ve …
Great food and environment! Family and friends friendly
Way overhyped and not worth a visit. The sandwiches are overpriced and their tastes are below average. Service is slow despite so many workers in the kitchen. Definitely not coming back.  NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
Overpriced ! But yummy ! The eggs were really good! I had the beef !
Very nice people and food. 10/10 recommend
Worth the hype! The orangey yolk is addictive
Decent Duck Fat hash browns.  Terrible seating concept.  Do not order the burger unless you like to eat pink meat. …
Easy to over order but glad no longer a crazy Q for a meal. Pricy
Taste great but price at the high side. Self service and no Q if you’re there for breakfast on the weekend morning.
Absoultely Delicious breakfast food! Atmostphete to similar to Chipotle. The name of the place is weird tho; I feel uncomfortable saying it.
Fairfax with Bacon - $15.00  I like the bun a lot, it&#39;s really soft. However, I don&#39;t think the sandwich as a …
Enjoy bacon,egg &amp; chees sandwich, the hot brew a bit cold when serve.
Had the scrambled eggs burger, truffle hash brown and iced black. Brioche bun was well toasted, fluffy and warm when we collected our order, eggs were also very soft and smooth. It’s good but pretty pricey ($12), I also felt the burger …
Great place to grab a meal - good ambience and was glad I could get a table even at peak hour. A tad on the expensive end but understandable given it&#39;s prime location. Food was good and decent. Generally fast service for the number of …
The two buzz system at the Orchard outlet was a bit confusing. Would suggest either direct the customer to collect the drink first and scrape the first buzz system or only let the customer collect the entire meal with one buzz. But overall, …
Pricey bun
No waiting,  quick to order.  Food was tasty.
Over a lot of grease …
Very packed during weekend lunch, got to wait awhile before getting seats.  Got a beef burger sgd 13.5 and truffle hash brown 5.5 = $19 damage. It is …
Buns were soft and pretty fluffy. Bring lotsa wet wipes as their namesake precedes them. The eggs are super runny. Tried the fair fax, sausage egg and cheese and the gaucho. All 3 were decent. The hash browns were fried on the spot hence …
Great food. Bacon burger is my fave here. And their signature cold brew. Recommended!!
Always long queue outside the restaurant then decided to give it a try. Personally feel the burger just ordinary, not worth it for the queuing time.
How can you mess up such basic food?  Bacon sandwich served cold with enormous amounts of tomato sauce, world class …
Recommended by a friend 🗣️ Not bad, but killed by the hype …
Their fairfax sandwich with avocado (add-on) is a must try.  The scrambled egg is creamy and the texture will make you want to have a second one.  Partner your sandwich with their original OJ to complete the experience.  A bit on the pricey side despite the small portion.
Came close to lunch time so the crowd had died down, didn&#39;t queue for long. Food wise, everything was oily and very heavily seasoned (salty). Orange juice was also exceedingly sweet. …
For egg lovers, this is the place for you!  Customisation works well for those of us who don’t want to waste food due to …
Wonderful egg breakfast sandwich and some of the best hashbrowns I have ever had.

5 star eggs served. Though not everything on the menu is nice, but go for the classic, won&#39;t be wrong.

Overpriced and it tasted like your typical egg toast that you can get at kopi tiam
The place actually is much nicer and family friendly than the name 😀 usually we avoid the place at the sight of long queues and also thinking only eggs are available there but the menu was quite decent and good value for money with …
it was not bad. but average taste like egg on toast. is it worth $12? no.
Ordered Fairfax sandwich.  Average, would’ve been worse if minus the buns(oily). …
Eggcelent meal for eggs
Truffle Hashbrown. 👌🏼 …
First time entering after my first unpleasant visit.  The outlet look clean and tidy which provide individual like us good impression …
Had the Gaucho - tender slices of medium rare steak and great chimichurri sauce. But really, the best thing about this meal was the warm brioche bun
Bacon, egg &amp; Cheese - Overall, quite pleasant. Would be perfect if a single thick bacon, rather than a few thin slices. Love the brioche bun. …

The bun is fluffy and delicious. But, not so much about the egg. I love the truffle harsh brown as the truffle is not over powering.
Tastes like an ordinary hamburger shop.
Super yummy though very filling. Make sure you head there with an empty tummy!
Open format kitchen, single cashier at entrance to greet and take orders. Not much interaction with staff as order was for takeaway, however, the server at pick up counter seemed to be having a bad day. Food was OK for takeaway and tasted …
Liked the presentation, hand wash station and efficient service. However the burgers are just a tad too greasy to enjoy: had the cheeseburger and the bottom bun was just too soaked in oil to even touch. The combination of the beef, egg, …
Good place for breakfast and coffee.
Overrated. I think Ramly burger is much tastier at a quarter of the price. Plenty of seatings so that was nice. Packaging seems to be made from the US. I rather they reduce this carbon footprint. My sausage burger wasn’t served hot. And I …
Enjoyed the food!
You think you can make fairfax sandwich? Think again. Fairfax and the hash browns are the only 2 items i would recommend. I would have given 5 star if it’s not too oily.
Ask for utensil if you don’t want to oily your fingers. Overall 👏🏻. …
Enjoyed having brunch at Eggslut and these days, there is no need to queue. Ordered the butter biscuit and was pleasantly surprised. I love the taste and the honey butter that served with it. A must try. Overall service was OK.
Came here for the burger…turns out can’t even compared to burger.
Fast in serving the customers
So much hype about this first outlet….but was not impress at all. It’s just another fast food joint that charges extremely high price for simple burger 🍔 sandwich. …
So much hype about this first outlet….but was not impress at all. It’s just another fast food joint that charges extremely high price for simple burger 🍔 sandwich. …
Review as Eggslut (Singapore)- Bacon, egg, cheese burger tastes different here compared to Eggslut LA. It’s thin and the ratio of bun to ingredients inside the bun is the same ratio I found in $2 Mcdonalds burger where the bun dominates. …
Good artisan burger uses brioche buns for starters
Friendly staff and good ambiance. I have tried Fairfax sandwiches and I added avocados it taste really good. Also I have tried hash browns. I would recommend the place.
great food and company people were decent!
Breakfast sandwiches are good. Slightly too greasy and overpriced, but still tasty. Avoid the long lines by going during non peak hours.
Great youthful ambience, the signature Fairfax sandwich was excellent.   The brioche was soft and flavourful,  and the scrambled egg was rich and silky smooth.
The food was okay. A bit oily. Craft soda is good.
Pre ordered take out. 3 burgers n 1 bag hash brown. Not bad tbh though a bit pricey n bacon a bit salty...
Bacon burger abit too salty. Cheeseburger not bad but to have scrambled egg in them, need to pay additional $1.5 each burger as originally they come with sunny side egg. …
Perfect for people looking for light food and yet healthy..love their avocado and prawn burger..must try!
Truffle hash brown , fresh orange juice , avocado and shrimp were great
Had the Fairfax and the prawn avocado sandwiches. Not sure what the hype is about. The sandwiches were just okay. Nothing fantastic. Granted they were slightly bigger than a normal sandwich but at that price point, they should be bigger. …
The food taste so so and quality is normal. Fancy names mainly.
Get the Truffle Hashbrowns
This is definitely the worse dining experience I had in Singapore, such that I decided to write my first ever google review for food. I went yesterday (17Sep22) on a Saturday noon time. …
The cashier XT was attentive even working from her position she was actively looking around and guiding lost firstimers to the right areas.
Best god damn eggs I&#39;ve had in my life.
The speciality coffee is extremely acidic and harsh. Do not understand why or how would anyone finds it to be a good brew. Suggest staff should highlight the acidity when patrons order the pricier speciality brew.
Eggslut has one of the best packaging for takeout. But the burger is meh.
Do not order the speciality hot coffee unless sour coffee is your thing. It’s supposed to be sour according to the staff as it’s more acidic. The eggs are done perfectly, I have the anniversary duo. It’s delicious with the …
Got the Fairfax and Hashbrowns. I really enjoyed the Fairfax, everything came together so well! The scrambled eggs, caramelised onions and cheese were just so yummy, and the bun itself was actually really fluffy too. I would say it&#39;s a bit …
Three words: duck fat hashbrowns. Yummy! Everything is tasty, but I would warn you that the sandwiches are heavily sauced. Let the cashier beforehand if you’d like the ketchup or mayo removed.
Went there around 10am on a weekday morning. Really nice n quiet. Great portion of food as well! 👍🏻 …
Everything was so delicious. Always seems to be a lineup but it moved pretty quickly. A little on the pricy side but very creative and tasty flavours.
Service by the staff is excellent! But finding a table is pretty annoying. Many are done with the food but chatting, gaming and working hogging the tables..
Am trying this sandwich for the first time. According to what I was told, there is always a long line for this cafe. Fortunately, my friend and I were able to find a seat, and on Saturday around 3+ there was absolutely no queue. The egg …
Am pleasantly surprised by how filling the bun is. Love the gooey egg yolk in this delicious comfort bun. Outlet is nicely lighted but would be even nicer if the exhaust system is better. Hair smelled oily after lunch in there.
Tried the fairfax and bacon egg. Nothing to shout about. Eggs were too creamy. Hashbrowns were good though. Queue moves fast.
I feel like this hasn&#39;t lived up to the hype around it which is a shame as I love any and all forms of egg. The food is good enough, but really the only options available are an egg variant in a bun which I think is quite limiting. …
The long awaited egg sandwiches have finally reached our shores!
Are the eggs really good? Yes!  But is this worth a half hour or longer wait? NO! …
Came here to have my brunch. Store is near &amp; clean, staff are very friendly &amp; food was made fresh upon ordering. Food is pricey but it was a good dining experience!
Overrated.
Overrated.
Had to try and see what the fuss was about. I had no prior experience to compare but all in all it was OK. The sandwich brioche bun was a better quality than at other chains, the egg in Fairfax was a little too creamy for my liking even …
Bacon, egg, sandwich was yumm
Good 👍🏼 …
good
Had the Fairfax. Loved the texture of the scrambled eggs most
Finally got a chance to try this. Usually a long queue and Monday morning is less crowded. Had a Fairfax sandwich and a black coffee. The eggs with Sriracha salad sauce works really well. The sour spike gave a good kick. Had the caramelized …
Give it a try when there is no queue. Quite spacious but full of customers in the restaurant. Love the runny egg yolk of the sunny side up egg and brioche bun! Rated 4/5 as there is slight sourish taste and not sure if it is due to the sauce or sausage itself. But overall still a good try.
Scrambled eggs in the Fairfax today could have been more creamy; it was oozing liquid. It&#39;s an &#34;okay and no harm trying for fun&#34; when you are in Orchard. Prices are probably justified by the location.
Good service but the fairfax burger is not worthid
Pretty nice food here. Weekend mornings are a bit busy so come early. Great hasbrowns and fluffy eggs!!
Restaurant tried to be edgy and cool with “slut” in the name. But it was all food made with poor quality. Very pricey. Disappointing. Pathetic portions.
Went there on Wednesday for lunch around 1pm, thankfully no queue! Even then they’re were only a few seats available. There’s more seat if you come In the late afternoon. Have been meaning to try but the long queue always puts me off 😂 Got …
Taste good but overprice
Overall is nice but pricey
Ordered Fairfax sandwich, however heard about small portion hence added patty for the burger. Overall Fairfax burger itself taste pretty good - scramble eggs was pretty well cook, very soft and feel like melt within your mouth without you …
I ordered a Fairfax sandwich and the Elderflower &amp; Lemon craft soda. The price for both the sandwich and soda is slightly pricey for its taste. …
Cool ambience and friendly staff, plus egg &amp; bacon sandwich makes a great morning breakfast. Can return to eat.
More IG crowd than anything else. Food is ok, but considering you are paying 12 bucks for a bun and eggs (even if they are free range eggs and good bread), &#34;ok&#34; should really be the starting point.
The cashier, Jamie Amir definitely need to watch what she’s saying. I was clarifying (I asked in a nice manner ) about the free birthday burger regarding how much do I need to purchase to get the burger. Instead she replied “ This is no such thing as free food in this world grace.  “ with a arrogant tone.
Hmm……… Sorry, really overrated! Mcspicy/Subway is way better!
You guys are doing an amazing work over there but you need to improve the waiting time The menu is kinda limited and more options can be added …
I feel this is very underwhelming. Overpriced food that underdelivers in taste and quantity.
Photogenic food with lousy taste. Bun used is of lousy quality.
Went on National Day, lunch (around 11.45am). Not too crowded. My parents and I ordered the Fairfax, bacon egg cheese, and single cheeseburger. Also the fresh orange juice and hash brown. …
The food was very good, the service was a little slow
Too pedestrian for the prices.  Average at best. …
Nice place for meeting and quick lunch. With nice fresh juice and sandwiches
Review on behalf for my girlfriend.  Ordered on Sunday 07/08/22. Receipt number: C091435. …
Had the Fairfax sandwich and the Bacon Cheese Egg one, taste wise the buns are soft and fluffy, so are their eggs- which are indeed cooked to perfection (as the name of the store boasts). However the major drawback for me was the pricing …
I was at the eggslut outlet last week and was served by a middle aged cashier who impressed me so much - firstly by how convincing she was at encouraging us to download the Happy Apps by telling us what we will get and also get gifts at …
What I had was an egg mayo sandwich 🤦‍♀️ It was egg, mayo and some rocket leaves in a bun.🤦‍♀️ And for $10.50 🤨 Kudos to the copywriter for writing such a great copy! 🤭 …
Overall quite a great experience but the price is on a pricier side
It was delicious!!
The fairfax is alright but not great. Pricey though and person who take order appears grouchy.
Food: 5🌟 Ambience: 5🌟 Service: 5🌟 Finally got the chance to try it with a lesser crowd. Got the popular Fairfax sandwich with add on beef patty &amp; the sausage, egg n cheese sandwich &amp;  their …
Me and my friends enjoyed our dinner at this &#34;atas&#34; fast food restaurant. The ambiance is very chill and relax and we like the theme of the eggs everywhere. The team in eggslut is very friendly and we felt welcome. …
Great food and great spirits from the staffs, especially NC! Told us how to redeem free food as well! 😜 …
Food serve was relatively fast. Particularly love their truffle hashbrown. Gonna be back for more eggilicious burgers.
Nice cold brew
Brioche bun is the star, quality wise for other dishes are above average. Price is too steep.
The brioche buns are the star for me, soft, fluffy, and buttery! Can be a little on the greasy side though, but bacon is crispy and every mouthful is juicy. Service is pretty standard. Good enough!
Comfortable casual egg sandwich restaurant. Grab a seat, order and wait for your buzzer to go off. …
Fairfax eggs are very salty but the bacon sandwich is extremely salty. I can only taste the saltiness and that’s all….
Had an early lunch here. Wanted to see what the fuss was about. Sadly disappointed. Not very busy but most free tables were dirty. Watched customers wiping down their own table. Had the cheese burger and found it a bit greasy. Nice concept but sadly just a posh McD. Sorry won&#39;t be coming back.
Passed by in the morning, wasn&#39;t any Q so tot l give it a try. Had the popular egg burger n truffle hashbrown. Egg burger was alright, truffle hashbrown was quite nice. Overall experience l wld give. 65/100.
Was here on a Saturday afternoon and only queued for around 20mins. Ordered the Fairfax and Bacon,Eggs and Cheese burger. The scrambled egg was well made! Personally, i felt that the fairfax burger was better. Would have been perfect if …
Perhaps a 4.5. Food is good. The egg cheese and bacon is tasty, so is the gaucho but its a bit pricey for what it is. Coffees are ok, not great. Overall, worth a try.
The sausage and egg burger was super yummy! Although the yolk got everywhere... It was quite messy 😅 but tasty nonetheless. …
Nice burger
Dropped by on a Friday night and didn’t need to queue, tables were available. Creamy eggs with the right consistency in the Fairfax sandwich but it can be quite a mess to eat and a tad oily. I loved the sriracha mayo and caramelised onions …
Awesome egg burgers
They have the most delicious hash br …
Very delicious but ultimate a very basic dish-  severely over priced and over hyped.
Nice
Food is not bad but I dont think its that good to deserve the kind of attention it has and the prices are too high! $12 for a bun with just eggs/cheese and some onions? I rather eat Shake Shack anytime.
I love the vibe and staffs. But honestly the food is okay.
Great place with great food. But need to improve on burgers. Truffles Harshbrown was so perfect for us
Lousy food and lousy coffee.
📍Eggslut @ Scotts Square  Ambience: 10/10 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ …
I don’t normally write reviews but the bacon egg and cheese was basically a ketchup sandwich, it was so bad. I literally had to look to see if there was an egg because I honestly thought maybe they forgot. …
Eggslut is awesome! NC is fantastic - 5 stars for him - great service and very friendly.
Eggs spill easily …
Came here before 9am, so there is no queue at all. Ordered the fairfax and also white coffee. the fluffy eggs pairs well with the caramelized onion and also the cheddar cheese. what i like the most probably is the brioche bun. the texture …
Different and highly enjoyable.
In love with the design 😂 …
Yummyy
We loved the truffle hash brown, and the flexibility of replacing the sandwich with a salad (at no extra cost)!
Delicious
Delicious food in general and fast service. Got recommended the biscuit which was disappointing. For egg lovers. Serving can be too huge for ladies.
The bacon sandwich is good, counter service is good today. This whole joint feels like u being in NYC.
Okay place to get some quick breakfast. Various concoction of eggs. It is good and delicious. It want something quick, fast and inexpensive, then this is your place to come and have some.
It was my first visit to Eggslut on 29/06/2022 about 8pm. Although hearing many different experiences shared by my friends I decided to try for myself. …
Chanced upon this early Sunday morning. There was no queue, but it was pretty early (just after 8am). I ordered the cheeseburger and my girl the Fairfax.  The brioche burger buns were nice and soft, but they were so very oily - the paper …
Ordered the Gaucho &amp; Fairfax + chicken sausage, truffle hashbrowns and an orange juice. - Didn&#39;t like the Gaucho, just wasn&#39;t justifying the more than 2x price tag. …
Terrible value. Taste is nothing special.
Food was great, worth the money really. Place seems nice and spacious.  Service, however, could be better. Your cashier seemed friendly enough but your …
Nice egg sandwich place
Famous restaurant, you can enjoy burger!
Arrived eggslut at about 3+ in the afternoon with not much people and no queue at all. Service needs a whole lot of improvement. Upon collecting our food, we asked them for a knife to cut our burgers for sharing portions instead. Was …
Don&#39;t really see why people queue to get in
flavourful truffle hashbrowns and very rich egg Fairfax. Nice patties in the cheeseburger as well. recommended.
We tried the Fairfax and the Eggs and Bacon choices and they were both cooked to perfection. The brioche buns were also soft, fluffy with generous amounts of butter to go with it. Overall a wholesome experience making this a regular breakfast place for me.
Was an okay sandwich shop, nothing spectacular really... Price too high 🙈 …
First time/try @eggslutsg Walked past and short queue!!! Gaucho sandwich has yummy beef in it! …
Love it!
My 1st trial n their sandwich is really tasty.  Well burgers r big and slightly costly for it.
Fairfax burger was peppery which is different from the last time I tried. Disappointing. The other burgers were definitely better!
Decent egg salad burger under 11 bucks.
based on fairfax burger, i give 4 stars. but pls don’t order the hashbrown. so salty and there is little to no taste of the truffle. might as well sell normal hashbrowns
Eggscellent experience!😋 …
I would say It’s a bit overpriced but the food was nice especially the bun was very soft and the truffle potato a bit too oily overall is above average just that the sitting is a bit too less will come again
Honestly overpriced.... spent more than 50 for 2 pax and we left feeling hungry. The portion is too small.
It&#39;s meh.
Finally got round to try. On its own it is good but against the hype and proce point not that great. …
It’s alright, good to try it once but that’s it. Nothing too special or memorable
Amazing burgers, their egg experience is out of this world!
Had takeaway. The burgers were still good after 2 hours.
$50 for two burgers, one special (Egg with potatoes and bread $11) and two drinks. …
$50 for two burgers, one special (Egg with potatoes and bread $11) and two drinks. …
A specialty store that uses the highest quality …
Great food and quick service
love the food it was good. extremely filling, great staff and nice atmosphere
Just normal burger with scramble egg. Price not met the expectation..  But the good thing is.... …
Noisy, not very clean, long wait for food (20 mins).  Food itself is not very interesting. Taste is just ok. Hashbrowns do stand out: original and good taste. Expensive. Lots of hype, didn&#39;t live up to promise. Unlikely to go back.
Just thought we should at least try it once given it’s hype - it does taste good at the start but eventually you will feel a little too oily.
Buttermilk biscuit very dry Burger is ok but not worth the price for the ingredients used and the quality.
Finally tried it. Not much of a queue close to lunch time. Buns and eggs were soft. Chicken sausage was a little too salty. Coffee was pretty decent.
Nice but very pricey
Went back to Eggslut a few days ago :) And instead of getting the Fairfax like last time,  got the sausage, egg &amp; cheese sandwich($12) but replaced the cage-free over medium egg with the scrambled egg for an additional $1.5. so essentially …
Sandwiches were lukewarm only.
Came in at brunch hour at weekday, the shop’s not busy at that time so no queue at all. The place was clean &amp; spacious. The service was excellent, the staffs were helpful in assisting us to choose our orders. …
Food is 100% over rated . I would rather eat at macdonald and the price is more reasonable.
Egg Salad Add Bacon Ice White …
Ordered the single burger. Burger was thin and the brioche is way too oily. The egg was probably the best, very running. …
Would be an Egg-cellent Egg-perience with the Fairfax Egg Sandwich if you’re an egg lover…. I wouldn’t queue for the food though.  The specialty- “the slut” didn’t quite impress. Check it out during off peak hours…
Portion is small and price is a bit high for just an egg, some bacon and bread. Food itself is so so, not as good as shack shake (too much ketchup!) …
Solid brunch place
The name is more eggciting then the food. Great for photos!!
I like eggs so this might be biased. This outlet has been very packed since it opened some time ago, but I did not want to queue for it. No queue today. Quite good, the mashed potatoes with the egg on top is nice and simple. The scrambled eggs in the burger seems to have a lot of butter cooked with it.
Best burger in town….
Love the fairfax! Service and ambience were great too. Nice place to hang out for brunch in town 🥳 …
Patronised a few times, enjoy the food! Really appreciate the amount of effort that goes into preparing the eggs to order.
Even with all the hype, i liked this place.
Food was decent and quite instagrammable, scrambled egg was great but not quite worth the hype and queue. Price was slightly on the higher end. The atmosphere was good. May consider going back again if theres a new item on the menu that looks good. Else, this just feels like a one-off thing for me.
jus tried this hype food chain 18 May 2022.. No Queue, jus walked in ordered n food served in 10mins, that’s the way. …
Expensive sandwich! Taste good!
ordered sausage sandwich and bacon sandwich. both were good but portions were a bit smaller than expected.
Nothing interesting actually. Over rated with pricy food
yummy!
Enjoyed their bacon sandwich
Overpriced!! This best seller didn&#39;t come with meat in it, only scrambled egg $12... added patty for $4.50 🙄🙄🙄 hash browns were $6 but soggy. Long wait so not worth it! …
too much rave about it. too greasy for my liking
Its just eggs and it was meh.
Very2 expensive for a very basic burgers taste...
In a nutshell, i just dont get the hype. It was good but not mindblowingly good and worthy of the long queue. …
Would only recommend the fairfax burger ($12), the egg was very fluffy and flavorful although it can get quite gelak. The cheeseburger ($14.50) was disappointing as the patty was super dry. The truffle hash brown ($5.50) was also quite underwhelming. There’s not much queue anymore.
Normal tasting egg burgers or sandwiches whatever u call them. $12 per pop. The brioche buns which were greasy were average IMO. The sausage McMuffin with egg or fish Fillet (nicer bun too) might be a cheaper alternative
Went for lunch on the 13/05 around 1pm. The supervisor that I collected my order from was extremely rude. For such bad  service, customers like me will never never patronised your store again. Shocking. I am a paying customer not there to beg for free food. .
The best eggs in the town. Must visit.
service ok with the cashier,friendly &amp; helpful. awesome burgers but no stirrers or small spoon given to stirr &amp; 1 pkt of sugar given when you order a coffee. …
Ok burger.
Good
Food is good but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll want to pay so much for egg sandwiches again. The hashbrowns are A+.
The sandwiches are nice. Though i think the food is overprics but worth trying especially when there is no more queue now.
Their iconic Fairfax sandwich would be a must try. Very eggy (lack of a better word) and buttery.
Beautiful and tasty egg sandwich, though quite expensive
Nice place. Suitable for a date with your camera - I saw someone feeding her camera, which somehow took as long as I did to eat a sandwich. I guess cameras are the true sandwich connoisseurs. …
Fairmont sandwich. A bit sloppy. Flavour average to good. a bit breezy.  Well balanced filling but not special in any way
Affordable Special cuisine
Staff at counter was very polite and provided us with the recommendations as it was our first time there. Food was served rather quickly and entire ordering process to collection was smooth. Tables were clean and organised. …
Love it!
Overrated. Good for Instagram photos. Queue system is confusing - people who asking me where is the takeout queue. I dined in… thinking I would be led to a table then the staff said it’s free sitting… alot of staff in the kitchen, the order …
Not too sure what the hype was about. Went there and tried their food but to our disappointment it was rather overrated. For the price, you can definitely get better standard somewhere else like even Fatburgers.
I read some reviews that this place is overhyped. I actually really enjoyed my visit here. I arrived fairly earlier, and the queue wasn&#39;t too long. Service was friendly enough, and the staff did make pretty good recommendations. …
Tried it for the first time and realised that there is a unique concept here, the eggs blend perfectly only if you know how to eat it without spilling the yolk.  Prices are costly and not that value for money
Food: quite nice Environment : very busy but still nice Service: some very good, some average. …
Burger meat is poor quality. But more unpleasantly - the server did not offer free water service. I am happy to buy a bottle but they had ran out.
A great casual dining experience, prices are reasonable considering the location and quality of the foods. Looking forward to returning again.
Overhyped IMO...food salt level could improve.
Just  burger with egg
Wow i can&#39;t say i like the food here. Its very very rich . Food is like fast food style not my thing
👍 …
👍 …
👍 …
👍 …

👍 …
If you like gooey eggs, this would suffice. The eggs were made really well and buns were toasted nicely. Service from the staffs were also prompt and friendly, however the price tag can be tad bit expensive for just a sandwich. Considering the location, this would make sense.
Just what I needed to get my day off to a good start
The famous scrambled egg in LA has opened its first door in Singapore at Scott’s Rd. …
Ordered egg sandwich Fairfax with topped up bacon and avocado. Come with a fluffy brioche bun which you can taste the butter in every bite. …
Delicious breakfast worth every cent!! Service was super quick and staff are helpful. The truffle hash browns are phenomenal.
very friendly staff &amp; the burgers are rly good!! hashbrowns are a must try 🤩 …
Very nice food! Ate it once in Japan, so happy that it’s in Singapore now!!!
Service staff is super friendly and nice and the food taste good! Recommended for meet up with friends here, ambience really nice ~
Great food and my kids love them!
If you like eggs you will enjoy this 👍🏻 …
The egg sandwiches are quite tasty and service is good. I&#39;m not a big fan of egg sandwiches but I still enjoyed myself. Would have preferred it if I could choose a different bread from the brioche but they don&#39;t have that option. I like it though that you can replace the bread with salad. That&#39;s nice.  Hash browns were really good too.
Good food but overpriced and long queue. Excellent service by the person manning the cashier.
First time trying eggslut and I really like it! I bought the cheeseburger and the bread was nice and the meat was also juicy. Remember to opt for the scramble eggs as it is recommended. The truffle hashbrown is ok as the truffle’s aroma is …
Nice sandwich fluffy egg n cozy place
Nice sandwich fluffy egg n cozy place
Took a while to try this place. Still as popular even though opened for a few months. Egg sandwiches are delicious as well as the hash brown and scones. Full range of drinks too. Need to try at least once to know if this is your thing but it’s popularity speaks for itself.
Fairfax + beef patty was extremely filling. Tastes good. But bun could be more buttery. Slightly dry. …
Ordered the bacon sandwich, it was tasty, bun was fresh and fluffy. Bacon was very salty, perhaps, it was seasoned more than usual. It is good as a lunch meal as it is not incredibly filling.
First time trying it! The first bite is the best! The egg yolk spilt open in my mouth and wow it’s amazing! Mouth watering great! This burger cost $13.50! I find it acceptable :) definitely worth a try! Went during a week at around 11am and didn’t have to queue much!
Hearty egg sandwich. Scrambled eggs were super fluffy and soft. The “slut” (egg with potato puree is super yummy too, nice and smooth texture. Has a chewy texture when pair with the baguettes. But a little on the pricey end.
Love the soft buns
Loved every bit. Patty was succulent and became coated with the egg yolk as I was biting into my burger. Buns were soft and grilled to my liking
Overrated for me. Bacon is good but the bun is far too oily. Had scrambles but feels normal
Food is overrated and over hyped. The bun was very oily and the beef in the burger was very difficult to chew. …
Awesome, the burgers are superb
Queue moves fast at around 130pm on PH, spent only 15mins waiting.
Queue moves fast at around 130pm on PH, spent only 15mins waiting.
Doesn&#39;t disappoint every time Also, you&#39;re paying for the brand name and the location But I&#39;d definitely go back for it
The food was good but the portion of the scrambled eggs got really small as compared to the past! Feels like eating an above average burger at a pricey range now
Very efficient breakfast &#39;fast food&#39; style restaurant. Breakfast sandwiches were delicious. Orange Juice was really good.
Not blown away by it . I think it’s overrated. Won’t go again. Their egg over mash was mostly mash potato at the bottom, making it very filling on its own . The burgers were just average.
My first time having it and I was impressed! The fairfax burger was really good, eggs were so creamy and good. Definitely will come back again.
Food is amazing, definitely a must-go
Good not great. Not worth the price. Thankfully no more queues now otherwise would be even more disappointing. …
Kids loved it , great service. Will come again anytime
Food is nice n over all environment  not back, just the wait part n ordering a bit longer n some items out of stock, price a bit ex
[Reviewed by IG Blogger: ef.foodie.sg] Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich (SGD 12) Overall level: 3/5 ⭐ @eggslutsg …
Had the double cheeseburger, bacon/ham/egg burger and ice latte. Food is good but a tad pricey which is typical of most F&amp;B outlets around Orchard Road. Overall, will still visit again in the future!
Ordered takeaway to bring home for breakfast on a lazy and rainy Saturday as the rest of the family was still sleeping. Order was nicely packed in environmentally friendly cardboard boxes which …
Enjoyed fairfax creamy scrambled egg sandwich add on bacon with orange juice.
I dont like the food there, and it is pricey.. Shake shack taste much better
We had the single cheeseburger with added bacon, sunny side up and fairfax with added avocado with a side of hashbrown. Not too bad for a first timer but i feel it can be made to taste much more palatable.
Firstly want to thank the staff named YL? for managing the crazy queue and being so attentive and professional during my turn as I was queueing but my friend didn’t show up on time, but he kept checking in with me when my friend is here so …
Weekday lunch there was no line. I got their famous Fairfax with extra patty and it was creamy and nice. My husband got the gaucho and it tastes very nice. I would recommend their gaucho sandwich over Fairfax. …

Disappointed that the burger came lukewarm, particularly the bun and patty.
High prices detract from an otherwise unbelievably delicious place to consume eggs. Come for the sandwiches, and maybe the biscuit. The coffee is ok.

Enter by outside Scotts, not inside. Ordered a fairfax (sgd12) and fresh orange juice (sgd5.5). Cashier was friendly and helpful, and offered to send my order to my table as I had an infant with me. Burger was messy but tasted great, …
Not bad taste and quality. However, value is questionable.
It’s okay, overhyped and definitely overpriced. Wldnt come again, half the time I was eating here I was staring at shake shack wondering why I didn’t go there instead… fav item was the hash browns…
really good
Good breakfast if you can get through the queues!
Great burger/sandwich option in town with relatively affordable prices. Their specialty is scrambled egg that is fluffy and well seasoned,  otherwise most sandwiches will come in standard sunny side up. Burger patties were moist but tend to …

Overhyped, overpriced, oversalted. Disappointed, not coming back. The only consolation is the coffee
Went when there wasn’t a queue, hence its worth the visit!  Ordered fairfax and cheeseburger - they’re delicious. Ordered the truffle hashbrown as well and it’s better than McDonald’s!
Absolutely love the truffle hashbrowns!
Creamy delicious eggsluts. Coffee&#39;s great too!
Very good sausage egg sandwich and the size is pretty big too, ordered side of hash brown also very nice
!!! 2nd time here ~~ TBH it’s rly for the hash brown!!! love em truffle hashbrowns &amp; ofc Fair fax YUMYum 🍳🥚🪺 delish! …
Friendly staff with Awesome food. Highly recommended
Lovely place
Yums!
Cool place
GREAT!
The most of egg options were good. Didn&#39;t like the burger.
It is a good place for brunch. Maybe 3.5-4 stars. Slightly overpriced for an egg burger but it does taste good! …

I personally think it&#39;s over hyped. Can eat lah, but there&#39;s better food around the area.
Delicious truffle hash - a must try! I love their chicken sausage sandwich as well :) Service is really lovely too. Great place for a indulgent “burger” meal with a nice ambience too.
Second visit with friends. The sandwich buns were not as soft as before. Some what I didn’t find this meal as enjoyable as before. I enjoyed the truffle hash browns very much, that really brings smile to me and my friends.
I was there just before the lunch time crowd started queuing outside. Lucky me and a few others who were ahead of me. First visit and I was told by a friend to drop by on weekdays instead and be …
I don&#39;t understand the buzz about it. It is basically an expensive brioche bun with a runny egg. The saussage patty or bacons do not present any interest. The hashbrowns were fine. The salad was ininteresting and pointless. The only thing …
Same as the one I ate in Glendale. It&#39;s a bit expensive though. But the fluffy scrambled eggs are simply great.
Love the fairfax creamy soft egg, added beef patty and avocado to it. The avocado goes well with the saltiness of the patty and egg. Refreshing orange juice to quench the thirst. Truffle hashbrowns far too salty for my liking.
Pretty good burgers but was honestly expecting more after all the hype so don&#39;t expect too much! Quite a long queue (40minutes wait) but service was pretty good! …
Best burger in town!  Love their fairfax sandwich! We ordered one with beef patty and one with bacon. …
Pretty good burgers with consistent quality. First time dining in whereas previous few tries were takeaways. Service was prompt as well. Well worth a try if you&#39;re around the area! Go for Fairfax with bacon add on, and the truffle hash.
Delicious and hearty egg sandwiches but too greasy to frequent. Crowds have thinned considerably so it’s easier to get seats now. The Fairfax does taste great with bacon and arugula tho 👌🏻 …

The sides are really good. The burger is nice too. But I hope they offer option to select either ketchup or chilli. The ketchup kinda ruin the burger for me. Otherwise their eggs are really nice. Freshly squeezed fruit juice.
Food was superb, seasoning was on point and bacon was the best. Ordered 2 Bacon sandwiches and 2 cheeseburgers, with truffle hash browns which were delicious. Service was great and atmosphere was cozy.
Really nothing special...
I never try the og Eggslut before, but I would definitely come back here again because it’s good. Love the buns and the creamy eggs. However, my overall experience was spoilt by the door host. I understood that sitting arrangements were …
For the price, I had expected something better than this. This is an average tasting bun with nothing definitive. For a shop that claims to specialise in eggs, I see nothing of that sort.
Finally gave in to the hype and visited on a Saturday morning. Wow still got queue! Didn&#39;t regret though. Simple food but done well! Friendly and cheerful staff!
Perfect breakfast! Special thanks to Jamie for warm hospitality.
Came today for Brunch. Food and service were both good and I enjoyed myself. Egg is soft and tasty, and I love the orange juice.
Clean! Loved the cheeseburger and BEC. Hash browns were nice, biscuit was a bit tough and dry. Overall great experience nonetheless ✨
I really enjoyed their Sausage, Egg &amp; Cheese Sandwich. I added bacon to it and it was all just so damn good! …
Food tastes great but I think the hype killed the experience for me. When asked if you want to change an ingredient, please check if you need to pay more... Paid an additional dollar fifty to change the sunny side to scramble... Felt a bit cheated. Cashier should have at least told me there&#39;s an extra charge.
Got the cheese burger which was really good as breakfast/brunch. The beef and egg was done really well. Surpassed my expectations for Eggslut.
Food is delicious and service is great.  Will be back again.
DELICIOUS!
Went there this afternoon.queue is not long but food is quite unique. Generally I love eggs with burger and they did exceptionally well. I definitely come back when there isn&#39;t queue.
Food was amazing! Service was great! Love it! 5/5
really bad food, eggs are not even salted
expensive but extremely tasty. worth the price.
Food was as per what we ordered. Tasty, worth the money and the staff were very welcoming. A must try is the fairfax. Will definitely visit again
Saw some bad reviews, and I have to say that I think they are pretty harsh. Just visited on a weekend, and I truly enjoyed my whole time there! Great food, great ambience, great service! 👍 keep it up! Note: Fairfax was a real winner! Yums! …
Their brioche bun is very soft and the scramble egg is nicely cooked and flavored.
Went here around 6pm and wasn&#39;t crowded thankfully.  We ordered 2 x single cheeseburgers with add on scrambled eggs, and as a side, …
Prior to our visit , were hesitant about going to Eggslut because of its popularity and the long queue under the hot sun. However, we were not disappointed, as we had a pleasant burger experience two weeks ago on a Monday morning . …
Enjoyable burgers! The Brioche buns are fluffy, and the scrabled eggs with yolk sauce is very good. Just a tad expensive - a sandwich plus latte costs S$18
We loved everything except for the buttermilk biscuit, it is hard and tasteless.
THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERIENCE :)
Awesome service and food by the team good job !!!
Came here on 2 different occasions. Food was great! Very tasty and hearty! The chocolate chip cookie could have been more moist. it is definitely towards the pricey side. Otherwise, enjoyed myself …
My second visit, no regrets and glad there&#39;s no longer a queue. We all enjoyed the eggslut but wish there&#39;s more toast to dig up the gooey eggslut. I&#39;m not a fan of the truffle hash browns - too salty for me - but my group loved it!
Lack of another star because of long waiting time, their coffee and the mashed potato not really that fantastic. Egg is nice but nth really special
Loved the hand brew coffee, it was by common man roasters. Meal portions were small but tasty
Crowd has died down already since opening but there is a steady stream of people. If u haven&#39;t tried this yet, worth a go. Fairfax sandwich is nice.
Felt that the food was a little underwhelming, huge hype but in reality it was meh. The truffle hash browns were a winner for me but those are from frozen. I do appreciate that the avocados were fresh and the bacon was the right amount of …
Date of visit: 8 March 2022 Time of visit: 1111am Location: Near Far East Plaza …
customer service at the counter is detailed and friendly high recommends good stuff but twice they pack meals to go. their signature scrambled is not on all the dishes you need to add that extra but their cheese burger and truffle oil hash browns are good didn&#39;t get a chance to try the honey biscuits so maybe 3rd time the charm cheers
Our 2nd visit today (6/3/2022) at around 3pm. Queue was alright. We ordered fairfax sandwiches &amp; hashbrown side &amp; disappointed at how salty &amp; oily the food was. We remembered it was much better back then when it just opened. …
Food is nice. Like their coffee. My kids love their truffle harshbrown. Just a little comment that their flooring feel a bit slippery when I walk.

Ordered the sausage, bacon and cheese burgers as well as truffle hash brown. Taste wise, burgers were just average. Truffle hash browns don&#39;t even have the slightest hint of truffle. Nothing fantastic. Don&#39;t think worth revisiting. Disappointing.

Ordered their signature fairfax sandwich. It taste ok like what you expect a scrambled egg will taste like. The caramelised onions or the siracha sauce is not strong though. …
It&#39;s rare that there are n …
Ingredients are fresh. The beef quality is good
Try the truffle hash browns.
first time trying and we ordered the fairfax and single cheeseburger. buns were very soft and everything went well together. pleasantly surprised as i thought this will be another overly hyped disappointment. the hashbrowns were a tad too salty for my liking but other than that, i think it’s worth a try :-)
Scrambled egg was extremely fluffy. Wonder what’s the magic to it!
Great ambience and food.
Weekday afternoon lunch time average waiting time 10-15mins for seating. Hash brown abit salty, can’t taste the truffle. Overall is okay to try, price slightly expensive though. Total meal: $21
Sad is how I would describe my experience at Eggslut. I gave in to the hype, and queued for 30min under the hot sun and ended up with massive disappointment. The food was average at best - sandwiches were ordinary, nothing innovative or …
It&#39;s so good. Unbelievable.
Overpriced hype.  Terrible coffee, when I asked for a new coffee they said I already drank it (yes... that&#39;s the point!) And they would give me milk if it tasted burnt.
Queue is always crazy here but was worth it. The craft soda was equally good as well. I love how soft the buns are and how they compliment the fillings.
I love eggs 😊 Enough said …
Pleasantly surprised!! I will say the egg tastes really good and the brioche bun is so soft! The service and ambiance is nice if you come earlier before lunch time. We ordered the cheese burger add bacon 🥓 and egg salad sandwich 🥗. I love …
Fluffy bun with wholesome smooth egg, I would recommend to add bacon to the fairfax instead of the beef patty
Very nice and delicious. Most importantly the portion is generous! We enjoyed it quite a lot also love the location. Ordered the Fairfax and Gaucho.
Salty and soggy. Overhyped and price is not cheap for the food and drinks. No food I also will not eat again!!
Had been hesitant to try Eggslut out due to hearing mixed reviews. However, I enjoyed both the Fairfax and Truffle Hashbrowns thoroughly! Well-seasoned, flavourful and not overly greasy. Already planning my next visit back!
Don&#39;t understand what&#39;s the hype and queue for this place. Burgers are pretty normal and nothing great to shout of but cost between $12-$17 with just eggs + few pieces of bacon, sauce sandwiched between a bun. …
Expensive. Additional $2.50 for avocado. Probably won’t patronize again if need to queue.
Great touch to replace the brioche bun with arugula salad!
Arrived at 12:55pm on a Saturday and waited for about 20mins to get seated. Food is consistently good (today was my second time trying Eggslut)! Their salted chocolate chip cookie was surprisingly good too.
Extremely poor and double standard customer service! Customer directly in front of me is able to enter and wait for her friend in the shop but they told me they will only allow sitting once my friend is here?! Not consistent with their rules and simply thinks that I’m blind.
Fabulous!
Very tasty
First time and the experience was great. Service is good, food is excellent. Nothing too salty or too oilly. Portion is decent for the price paid. Great place for a nice burger at a decent price in town.
Above average burgers with scrambled and sunny side up eggs. Hashbrowns were good tasting but not crispy and slightly soggy. Chocolate chip cookie was good and fulfiling though. However, their butter biscuits are awful and overpriced; would avoid them at all costs

Third attempt at trying to come here for brunch and finally managed to get in this week at 10am. queue wasnt too bad, it was probably just 5-10mins wait for 2pax. I came here same time on different day and queue was much longer. Once we get …
Got Bacon Egg &amp; Cheese and Buttermilk Biscuit. Both were pretty good, queue moves surprisingly fast. bacon is crisp but a little salty (as bacon tends to be). Egg is pretty good but not mind-blowing. The biscuit was a surprise and worked well w the honey butter
Huge Fans of Eggslut Japan but abit disappointed with Eggslut SG 1. Egg not creamy enough 2. Bun (bread) not fluffy enough …
No queue on a Saturday. Burgers were nice.
A newly opened hamburger and sandwich shop. There is often a line in front of the store. I ordered a double cheeseburger, truffle …
Fairfax sandwich was pretty good. But overpriced for its size which wasn&#39;t even enough to fill me up. Orange juice was exactly like the ones u buy from a supermarket but u pay 5x more. Wouldn&#39;t go back if I can
Food taste meh. Wonder what the hype is all about. Not worth queuing.
It is indeed a different style, but tasty. But only if you eat it as composed. If you drop certain elements it will be not the same. Clear, but for this kind of food it is even more significant. At the end, it is a good alternative to put in your fast food plan.
Best egg sandwich in the whole wide world 🤩 …
Most of us have heard of this place by now. Some say the food is overpriced, others say it&#39;s over-rated.  But all of us have our own preferences.  I love the food here! Scrambled eggs are my favorite and also the bacon! Bun is so soft and …
bacon, egg &amp; cheese sandwich is pretty good! bacon is very crispy, egg is flavourful and fluffy, the only down side is they add too much ketchup! overpowers the true taste of the burger. rmb to ask them to tone it down if u don&#39;t want to …
We had the fairfax, the different flavours/herbs had a good balance. It&#39;s worth the hype! I enjoyed this burger, though i do feel it is overpriced.
Nice
Food is amazing Coffee is awesome Was greeted by NC who is the staff of the place. Have no idea what to order so …
Finally got to try eggslut!!! Had the Fairfax + avocado and it was super filling for the price! …
Great for a hearty brunch. Queue is not that long now.
Horrible service.  Over-rated food. …
Defo not worth if I have to queue for it. Thank God I don’t have to. Considered pricey for oily eggy bread. I don’t find any satisfaction eating this.
Didn&#39;t have to queue for long at 1030am on lunar new year eve. Creamy and rich eggs on a fluffy brioche were quite flawless, the poach egg on mash is a winning combo. The hashbrowns arrive slightly soggy but the duck fat did make it quite yummy
The most delicious eggs encased in warm, pillowy brioche bun. Go for Fairfax and you won’t regret. The bacon was a tad too salty. Friendly staff gave us cute egg spectacles!
Seriously overated food chain from the US of A. Consider yourself as eggslut food court rather than a restaurant since everything has to DIY. …
Almost no queue in the early morning. Order was done at the entrance. Ordered cheese burger, Fairfax sandwich, truffle hash brown and ice black coffee. Serving size was above average. One burger is probably more than enough for breakfast. …
The cheeseburger are really delicious! The side orders are not so good. Would go back again.
I do agreed with some of the patron review here. It is overly hyped, and the food taste normal. Usually at such price, the food would have taste better with some wow experience. …
What seems like a simple meal kept my tummy and heart full. The food was awesome and savoury. And super mentioned and about out to Alethea for the expert recommendations when my friend and I were so torn between choices. Thank you for the meal.
Bacon, egg &amp; cheese on a greasy bun for S$12. Salty, hard bacon, yolk was broken, stuck on the bottom of paper holder. Where’s the cheese? The tomato ketchup was overwhelming. I’m trying my best to pick something positive… staff was polite, …
Good service by Nicholas and team!
Pretty disappointing. The brioche buns seems to be left out for quite awhile and isn&#39;t toasted before being served. The eggs are nothing special as well...
Bit of a queue on a Monday night, but service was efficient and pleasant. The brioche buns for the burgers were delicious and fluffy, and the meats were tender and juicy. If you order the sunny-side-up aka &#34;over medium egg&#34;, watch out …
Nice egg sandwiches! Very confusing queue with nobody to maintain order as people just cut queue.
Sometimes I pay more for simple food elevated by premium ingredients and superb culinary skills. This time, I’m not sure what I’m paying more for. The Fairfax tastes really mediocre — totally not impressed with the cloying mushy scrambled eggs as well as the dry, airy and bland brioche bun. Overhyped.
Not worth the hype nor the queue
The Fairfax . . . sooooooooo good I had seconds!
Weekdays also need to queue, Nice bun, warm sandwiches Fresh orange juice
It was raining and I waited outside, but they were very kind to lend me an umbrella.  …
Shout-out to Nicholas for being such a stud. After my friend and I placed our order, he offered to change our table as it would be more comfortable for us. We were served drinking water immediately after we were seated. He also offered us …
Heard about this place many times. Our first time there the queue was too long so decided not to queue. Second time we went early for lunch (before 12pm) and still had to queue for 15 min. Had a couple of sides and 2 sandwiches. The …
Just like California vibe Long queue but worth to try Coffee biscuit and shut are the best combinations for me for light breakfast 😋 …
Greasy, overpriced food. Go for the hype once
Nice lunch choice:)
Went on weekday around 830pm. No queue at all. I ordered double beef patties cheese burger with add on avocado. Surprisingly the patties aren’t salty. But the patties and egg ain’t hot enough to melt the cheese. Hope they look into it. Overall, it’s a good experience and willing to visit again.
Great place and the food is so so tasty
Apart from the steep price. The food was absolutely fulfilling. Had the scrambled add on bacon and the egg texture was perfect and holds together with biting into it. The amount of bacon was adequate. The truffle hash brown is good
This is a nice place and if you want egg in your food, this is the place! All the egg that you could get :p
Lucky to dine in without queue. Overall, good food and service. Ordered fairfax with bacon and mini hashbrowns. Hashbrowns are fried nice and crispy. Fairfax would be better on its own. The additional bacon is too salty for me.
The burgers are good and the egg in the burgers held well even when the items were ordered as a takeaway. Would go many times again and again if the price point is slightly lower.
All hype and novelty.  Not worth your time to queue especially if you have to stand under the hot sun.  We were there on Saturday about 10.45am and had to queue for about 20 mins.  Ordered the Bacon, Ham &amp; Cheese burger .. brioche bun was …
Overated. Very salty.
So so. Expensive fare for whats essentially fast food. Not sure what&#39;s the hype about
Overpriced food and overrated… that is the worst place ever. Why would someone pay so much for just eggs cooked in that simple way. I can do that at my own home
Great place, will visit the 2nd time if I am around the corner
Worth to go and give it a try if there isn&#39;t any queue. Not the kind of food that I would stand in line for.
To be honest it’s not so bad but $12 for an egg and bacon sandwich is really very fancy. On top of that we got 6 small round pieces of has brown for $4.50. You’re paying mostly for the hype and of course, cage-free eggs.
Too greasy for my liking, slightly expensive. Not worth the long queue
Came on new years day for late lunch bite. Thanful that there was no Q, otherwise would not have Q to try. It felt like another shakeshack dissappointment, expensive and nothing fantastically great. The place felt dirty as well, with …
Good food but may not live up to the hype. The queues do move pretty fast.
Good food, ambience and service. Staff are professional and polite. Background music can be softer though :)
Sandwiches were nice. But no way worth the price. A little overrated.
Where do they keep all the eggs? :O
Long Q but worth it. Food is great. Place is great. Must try breakfast if you’re in the area.
The brioche buns are delicious. The sandwiches are ok, however not worth long queue / wait time. Visited on a weekday afternoon and took around 30 mins to takeaway. There was an extremely long queue to dine-in.
extremely disappointed. hashbrowns were soggy - obviously cooked too long ago and left out. but the worst part was that both sandwiches (fairfax and bacon) were served COLD, not even warm. not sure if they’re making the sandwiches way in …
Food is so-so....not much varieties...
Burgers and the mashed potato r nice and juicy  but far too pricy
Waited about half an hour or so on Monday morning around 10am. While signature burger is ok (they do make good scrambled eggs), the cheeseburger is delicious with the pickles, running egg yolk and pan fried brioche buns. Iced coffee is …
A hip and trendy place 😊 Food is not bad though limited selection. Egg yolk is more orangy than typical egg. …
i love their scrambled eggs!! really perfectly done. the aioli sauce in the fairfax sandwich is dapplin too. …
A must have when you come to Orchard Road!
Lovely ambience with amazing egg - gauncho sandwich worth it
Average burger with truffles hash brown which was quite salty.
The food is awesome. Go before 10am for shorter queue time
Mediocre. Try out the Fairfax sandwich and add the patty, but at that price shake shack is a much better option.
I mean - buttery brioche, creamy scrambled eggs, slightly spicy mayo - how could the Fairfax be bad? Only recommend adding bacon or beef for a bit of texture, though it does add to the greasiness. Truffle hashbrowns are oily too. But you&#39;re …
Prefer the sausage bun more than the bacon bun. Went there at 8 am and there wasn&#39;t much of a queue. Would not queue for this. Rather have shake Shack🙂 …
Had the bacon, cheese and egg sandwich this morning 22/12. The WHOLE sandwich was served not even lukewarm. Brought it to the kitchen staff, they did exchange but the new one was only slightly lukewarm. The bacon was too salty and whole …
Visually appetising.  That&#39;s it... Not worth it at all.
Was here at 8.30am on a Tuesday morning so there was no Q, ample seating. However as we got to 9.45 onwards the place was filling up. Was told by friends that weekends have long Q’s. …
Had the cheeseburger and topped up for bacon. Opt for bunless which they changed to salad. Love the beef patty! Food is good. Just find the bacon and truffle hash brown a bit too salty. But I like the idea that they offer you salad in replacement of the buns :)
Finally visited this hyped up joint on a Friday morning. Took about 15-20 mins in the queue so that’s bearable though I can’t see myself queuing longer than 30 minutes to eat this. Good news is the food is very suitable for takeaway and you …
Food is incredibly delicious. Fairfax is a must try. The brioche bun is soft and eggs are beaten and cooked creamy. I would definitely go back there again
When there is no crowd, rush in to eat.  I finally got it for me.  The food is good, but a bit salty. It&#39;s okay I still ate the food.
We ate the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich and the Fairfax with Beef Patty Sandwich. Both were yummy! We added the Truffle Hashbrowns as well and they tasted great too!
Fianceé and I loved the Fairfax and Double Cheese Burger! If you hate to queue up like me, weekdays 2-4.30pm will be perfect.
The food was good but can a bit pricey so keep in mind!
Popular place for eggy sandwiches etc. My sandwich (Fairfax) was absolutely delicious, but unapologetically greasy and gross ... which I think is roughly their concept. …
We got cheeseburger and bacon, eggs and cheese. At the price point, honestly I cant say much - just that I would not return anytime soon.
Fairfax sandwich ($12) with avocado ($2.50), take away. Delicious burger but $14.50 for bun, scrambled eggs, chives, caramelised onions, cheese, mayo and avocado is a little overpriced.
Go in the morning to beat the queues. It&#39;s really a breakfast sandwich anyway. Worth a try but pricey. Coffee is not too bad too.
The queue and overall waiting time were really long. Perhaps could wait until the hype die down. Overall, the food was pretty good.
The only downside for me was that there&#39;s no chili sauce for my burger. There&#39;s only ketchup, ketchup, and more ketchup. Okay, and mayo, too. …

Had this as dinner with my bestie. The sausage just taste with nice.
One of the better burgers(?) around town.. however the queue can be horrible…
Buns were soft and moist, on point. Bacon was crispy! Only disappointing factor was that my burger was not hot at all. Which in fact affects the whole experience. …
Honestly… overrated 🥚 sandwiches. The area and prices are okay. I went there on a Friday around 6pm with no queue outside. We wait around 10 min + to get our order. Not sure if I will go back there. Still don’t get the hype. …
I wonder what is the hype about this and decided to try. Had the bacon, egg &amp; cheese burger and the Fairfax burger.  It is a such a disappointment. You are better off going to shake shack, macdonalds and carls junior.
Great breakfast/brunch place. However, do expect a queue, so go a little before your appointment time to secure a table.
Finally managed to dine in when I passed by eggslut last Wednesday, 6pm. I remembered to add beef patty otherwise there was no other meat in the Fairfax sandwich. It was a pricey sandwich but worth it as the bun was super soft and everything went well together.
Fairfax - scrambled egg was rather well done but all it&#39;s goodness is drowned (literally) by the disgusting amount of oil that coated the rocket leaves. Bacon, egg &amp; cheese - came cold??? buns were not fluffy and so hard. Awful. $12 for literally 2 eggs and a bunch of leaves.... regret coming here, please don&#39;t come here
Decent sandwich, but definitely don&#39;t queue 30 mins for it
Been there once and the food was great, and we visited a second time today. Was told that there was no beef patty available only after we queued 1 hour in the sun on a Saturday afternoon. We left disappointed. Why didn&#39;t they informed the …
The queue on a weekend morning is around 20mins for 2 pax. We tried both the cold brew and the hot brew and they were both surprisingly nasty, you have to try them for yourself. …
Waited half an hour from 10am on Saturday. A crowded restaurant. Staffs is not friendly, especially the cashier staff, not speaking politely and use hand to tab on the little memo that placing on the ordering machine instead of speak out politely the unavailable items. Hope the service can be improved.
Visit once n not worth going again. Nothing fantastic about the food, drinks nor ambience. Only attraction is the automated handwash
If you love single use plastic, slow service and very average yet overpriced food, this is the place for you…. 30 minute wait for stone cold food…first and last time I’ll drop in….no recycling for plastic and paper = shocking
Nothing special. Just normal eggs and fresh food. Won&#39;t come all the way for it especially if got long quene.
nice place to hang out!
Everything about this spot is great. The corner lot with large windows and seating that allows you to enjoy your meal and watch people go by. And the food which is simply excellent. This is not your average all day breakfast sandwich. Full of flavor and simply perfect in every way.
Great place! Well worth the queue!
Waited for a friend for more than an hour outside the restaurant, manager was very attentative and was very kind to offer me a seat inside whilst waiting. Top notch customer service and excellently accomodating of customer&#39;s needs. Food was, needless to say, eggcellent.
Did a takeaway order at around 5pm, but the Q is about 20-25 mins (non peak). The initial taste was good, but it was too heavy for me towards the end. After forcing myself to finish the upper end burger, I get a bit sick 🤢 …
If you don’t mind the queue and pricey tag, the food taste goods. The bun is unique and fluffy and the eggs are nice. However, it is not cheap. You can pay similar price for a nice brunch place. It is worth a try but don’t expect too much per the hype the store receives so that you can enjoy the meal. ;)
Staff are nice, but food is somewhat over rated, making the price is a tad high.
The four of us enjoyed our first experience to this popular cafe yesterday. We made it in at 830am and sat comfortably, before the queue started forming outside after 9am. The portion size at first looked slightly small for the price we …
Painfully average tasting food at high prices and long queue. Waited about 30 mins to get in. Not worth the hype. Do yourself a favour and go to Two Men Bagel for a far superior experience instead. …
Great hangout place for eggs and bacon lovers. The food is a tad bit pricey however the quality of its product is of the highest standards. Eggs used are cage free and sustainable. Eggslut also sells merchandises which you can explore just opposite the cashier. Its definitely an Instagrammable location!
Flavourful scrambled eggs with soft fluffy buns. Tried the Fairfax and Cheeseburger so far, they are both great!!
This place is bussin/10🤤🤤  I loved the baconeggncheez 😩 sandwich (picture), the saltiness of the bacon + gooey yolk + buttery toasted bun is worth the heart disease for …
Good food Ordered the double cheeseburger and the scrambled egg burger They are nice in their own way. Scrambled egg was not excellent but well done …
Long queue, luckily it moved relatively fast. You can customise your burger by adding different items. The burger looks appetising and the scrambled eggs has a rich whiff of smell. Ordered avocado to go with the egg, should have added beef …
Tasteless Fairfax Sandwich. Egg too salty. Beef pattie taste faky.  Hashbrown were nothing special. …
Lacklustre flavour, egg was bland, brioche bun was way too soggy. Meat tasted frozen
Lacklustre flavour, egg was bland, brioche bun was way too soggy. Meat tasted frozen
V creamy eggs n sloppy goodness
Biscuit and OJ are awesome
After eating at shake shack I liked some burgers. I went to eggslut on the weekend and they serve big portion burger and was very delicious. It was also a decent restaurant style and the service was decent. The food was astronomical and I …
Beware of the egg inside the burger. It will shoot out when you bite it. Just use plastic knife and folk over the plate. Come earlier 30mins for the Queue. Might be looks long but fast. 😊. …
Crowded when I am there
Tried for first time at this new outlet at Scotts Square. The Bacon, Egg &amp; Cheese sandwich was too salty.
Love the sandwiches! Would highly recommend theslut (mashed potato with boiled egg) A must visit if you are a egg fan!
Not bad for the first try
I would say it’s really not bad! But if I need to queue more than 15-20mins to eat this, then I would probably pass. If there’s no queue, it’s definitely worth a try. The truffle hash brown is good, but you need to be able to take salty …
Went on Sunday around 9pm. Short queue with a few tables available. Some tables are dirty, have to clean with own wipes. Find the burger a little too salty. Price slightly on the premium.
Average food, ambience is nice. A queue at peak hours
Q-ed for around 30-45mins on Friday lunch hour time. Slightly pricey but the sandwiches portion is big and definitely very filling. Love the hashbrown as the taste of truffles and duck fats is strong but not overpowering, Buttermilk scones is too dry for my liking.
Soft tasting brioche buns with peppery, saltish tasting scrambled eggs ...
To be fair everything else that we tried were yummy, except the egg where the 2 star reduction came from. Being an egg expert, I would have expected &#34;OVER MEDIUM&#34; from them to be the real over medium, or else don&#39;t write over medium in the …
Went at around 9.45am on a Monday and was in a short queue of 6 group…waited around 10mins and got entry to order food and was informed it’s free seating. So if u are alone, I am not sure if u can get a seat if you order first. …
Food is nice. But there&#39;s no social distancing between us and another couple. The staffs seems to be too busy to concern about that.

KFC or MCD might be a better choice 🤔 …
Fairfax Burger is great as raved about. Had to queue early in the morning to dine in. A little more pricey for a casual burger place but the taste makes up for it. …
Had the bacon egg and cheese and fairfax. The sriracha mayo makes the fairfax unique. The brioche buns were very well done. …
Food great as always. Staff managing the line was super kind and helpful.
Egg but overpriced, overhyped, taste average.
Fairfax sandwich dine in. Is it supposed to be served cold ?
A little slow but I finally tried @eggslutsg 🎉 Of course must try Fairfax given that it is their most popular item haha 🤭 …
Only visited the place due to zero waiting time, on a Tuesday afternoon. Ordered Fairfax and Egg salad, along with fresh orange juice. The juice was nice. The egg salad bun would have tasted nice if it was warm. It was also not that …
food: 3/5 price: 4/5 (incl gst, no svc charge) service: 1/5 - queue mgmt staff instructed us to take high chair seating, and …
Fad? Perhaps... you decide after your visit.
Taste very normal
Nice place
ordered takeaway so I could get a shorter wait. Got the fairfax burger with an additional beef patty for $4. It’s pretty salty but the scrambled eggs were really good! While it doesn’t look big, the sandwich was very filling and is big …
There&#39;s always a queue but it moves pretty quickly. Fairfax and truffled hash browns are a must-try!
Honestly it just a premium McDonald’s burger. Food quality is good just I will not q it for second time as nothing outstanding and the manager service attitude is really poor.
If you are into bacon their crispy bacon with chipotle sauce is definitely a good blend. But its a messy affair to eat as thr egg yolk will flow right through it. Lastly, super oily grease.
Greasy, overly-salted beef patties; mediocre at best. The price is a slap in the face as well. The staff were friendly though. But it&#39;s a complete miss.

I love this place, a bit overrated but still yummy. Recommend. Queue was not too long. Most items on the menu are not bad
We passed by and there wasn&#39;t a queue and we needed an early dinner before a movie. …
I&#39;m not burger fan but This&#39;s on Must try list! Yummy egg burger for EGG lovers! Fairfax Sandwich with truffle hashbrown&#39;re perfect. …
Came in without high expectations and it was surprisingly better than I thought. Yes, the high price tag discourages repeated visits but I seldom see places execute that brioche buns and eggs so perfectly. I can&#39;t find another similar one …
Very JENG &amp; @ reasonable price too. What u c is what u get. The price is inclusive of da GST and seems like no service charge is required altho 10-20+ crews are working to serve you. Would like to try again but the problem is the queue, even on weekday also need to queue arr.. N 2nd part of the queue is under sun/rain
Not as bad as what the lowest raters commented. Buns are warm, patties and burger ingredients neatly between buns. Not a messy meal. Pretty nice.
I&#39;m here to add in to the overpriced yet mediocre food one star review, cause Singaporean will pay big money for expensive food that is overhype. Only good thing is the bacon is pork.
here with my wife for the 4th time already. Love the food ever since I tried them in US. Wait time has decreased since opening month and the staff has been excellent!
Overall a good expereince but wasnt worth the hype. Water was expensive for a small amount, but the food was good! Dont get the orange juice though
Long queue for something way overhyped.. Had the fair fetch which is the supposed &#34;famous sandwich&#34; way too oily for my liking. The egg is decent but the beef patty lack a punch... Overall food is salty and u would need to have water on standby..
Food is pretty good, hashbrowns are a must order!  Food: ordered the fairfax with beef, bacon sandwich and the hashbrowns. First of …
Egg switch inside is cold though.
Burger is good!
Normal burger, nothing special
Friendly staff. If ask me to come here eat again I wouldn&#39;t cos I feel not worth the queue
Nice breakfast place. Love the buttery brioche with watery yolk eggs. To avoid the long queue, go during breakfast time. Do expect cafe prices for these egg sandwiches.
Hash brown crispy but oily. Fairfax is also oily.
Selected the Fairfax sandwich ($12) and added a beef patty ($4) for takeaway as there was too long a queue even on a weekday lunch. …
Actually this is NOT worth the hype. Go there once if you curious to try but actually nothing great lah. Ordered the cheese burger $13.50 and truffle hash browns $4.50. There’s no GST …
Most of the reviews here bit harsh. Went to buy takeaway around 5-6 during the weekday. Everything went smoothly. Yes for takeaway must wait outside. …
Nice sandwich! Taste really good. But also very premium
#lazymsketo out on the prowl again, happy to see a salad swap option listed right on the menu and I finally got to visit the Eggslut in Singapore with minimal queue at 2:30pm in a weekday afternoon. But with the addition of avocado and …
Me and my dining partner went on a Monday afternoon ~1430hrs, there was a reasonable 20 pax (10 pairs of 2 individuals) already queuing. Once in, it was free seating, a plus point. …
It was crowded when I got there but definitely worth the wait!will return
I went on a Thursday afternoon at about 12pm. It was only a 15-20mins wait for dine in. (I was expecting to wait for at least an hour.) Food was great. Ordered Fairfax and Sausage, Egg, Cheese Sandwich. The buns was so good.
Tried their truffle hashbrown, Fairfax sandwich and craft soda. Truffle hashbrown a must try.
Queued for about 20min on a Monday around 11am. Had the fairfax and hash browns. …
Not worth the price, the hype and the queue at all!
⁣ We ordered their best-selling item, as recommended by the staff.⁣ ⁣ …
Loved the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich and Truffle Hashbrowns. Bun (Soft and fluffy), Egg (lives up to it&#39;s name), Bacon (lightly salted) was on point and the Hashbrowns had a light Truffle flavor. The Gaucho Sandwich was hearty with a …
Gave this a try with my family during a public holiday. Queue was long when reached but was managed quite well. Ordering and collection was pretty quick and fuss free. Brioche bun was soft and fluffy. It was very fragrant and tasty! Egg …
The atmosphere at Eggslut was pretty but I think I might have been expecting too much from the hype for Eggslut. Not that the food is not nice, it was. Except that the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich ($12) tasted too similar to Macdonald&#39;s …
Bun is cold, taste is bland. the only thing amuse me is the overprice.
Love it !
Needed to queue for a while. Better to visit early or at off peak hours. Wide space and the food is great. If you love scrambled eggs for breakfast with soft buns and bacon this joint is just for you. There are other choices from the menu.
Nice fluffy eggs made the sandwich a notch better than others. Recommended although a bit pricey.
Quite tasty. Had to queue for quite a while. Perhaps it&#39;s a public holiday that causes the longer than usual queue. Coffee is good.
Not worth the hype and the queue. Door staff were pleasant but didn&#39;t inform us to place our orders before looking for a seat so we wanted to find a seat but another staff told us to place our orders and she&#39;ll find us a seat after. Done …
Love the burgers!! Great service!
Did takeaway, waited for 15 minutes outside (yes, if you do takeaway, you will need to wait outside). Went in to check if my order was ready, AND THEY SAID THEIR MACHINE DID NOT CAPTURE MY ORDER! so i had to wait even longer for them to prepare my order. Will not be going again, would not reccommend
Dirty tables, food is meh, not worth the price and hype.
The food is overrated yet overpriced
Great place to eat. Part of a US based food chain and seems popular. Went for lunch with a friend. Had the Bacon, Egg and Cheese, while my friend had the Fairfax and a Craft Soda. Quality and taste was excellent. Burger buns were soft and moist, the egg was perfectly done as also the bacon. Definitely a must visit!
The eggs are done really nicely and the brochie bun are lovely. It’s not worth the queue though.
Came on a rainy weekend but there was still a horrendously long queue. Their fairfax sandwich was amazing and worth it but their egg salad wasn&#39;t as great. …
Seriously how difficult is it to a scramble eggs 10 staff @ at work @ the egg counter(s) but still an extremely long waiting time. Not impressed…😒 …
Great place to dine.. very chill layout with see through kitchenette where you observe the multiple chefs at work on your burgers. One burger too full...
Worth the wait. The burgers are one of the best I have eaten 🤩 …
Abit of a queue on a weekend. Food is good, tried the Cheese Burger. Once you ordered your food, the service is fast. Food served is hot. I like the hash browns best!
Read all the reviews while waiting in line to dine-in and two of the most common complaints I&#39;ve read so far are: …
The taste was normal and is pretty overpriced. Having to queue for such a long time to get to try this was not really worth it but it is still not too bad for an egg sandwich. I just expected more
A lot of hype about this place and a lot of mixed reviews too.  Sausage, Egg &amp; Cheese Sandwich - $12 …
I came on a rainy day, so luckily for me, I did not have to wait for a long time. Food was really good, but for me the hash brown (side) outshone the sandwich (main). Overall food was really decent and the price was ok for the quality
Can&#39;t recommend it enough. Out of the things I tried, my number one pick has to be their truffle hashbrowns. Absolutely amazing. The flavour was just right; not too pungent or salty. Their salted chocolate chip cookie is delectable too. Brioche buns were great :)

Great spot, long queue
Eggslut has arrived on the Singapore shores and we boarded the hype train to try it out. We went on a weekday morning but we still had to queue outside before being allowed to order for dine-in. …
So good. As good as the one I had in LA!
Food is pretty and pretty good. Was expecting it to live up to the hype thus I was slightly disappointed. But overall it was a good place for your burgers
Food was subpar but highly recommend the hashbrown!
Very nice will go again
Food was ok tbh. Might pop in for a meal if there&#39;s no queue or takeaway. I think if you haven&#39;t tried, can wait for the hype to die off a little or when they expand. Prepare to spend a bit of money too. Nevertheless, good to try it once …
As expected on several visits. Today had their supposedly famous big prawn hor fun - too watery and lacking in wok hei.
Ordered big prawns hor fun. It&#39;s off its high expectations. The dish is very watery and the kway tiao lacks wok kei. Paid $20 for this. Service is at bare minimum.
Shrimp was delicious. The restaurant you want to visit again next time
The food is so delicious👏 The ser …
Went there for lunch. Bustling and noisy atmosphere. Food was very flavourful and enjoyable. Best compliment is that I over ate 😂
Decent food. Spend about 79 for 3pax including 4 dishes, 2 rice and 3 drinks. Waited for an hour, starting the queue at 6pm. They will only seat you when your group is complete. Fair enough.
Generous with their portions &amp; prawns 🍤 for every dish. Can expect to be quite full from ordering few dishes.  pricey for a tzechar place.  If you like thick starchy gravy, you will like their dishes. Thick rice noodles for the horfun was packed separately for takeaway &amp; had a charred wok fried look. Yong Tau foo which is the popular favourite was quite tasty.  Be prepared to queue &amp; wait (both dine-in or takeaway) especially during peak weekend hours.
Still delicious and much larger space compared to the old shop lot.
My fav tze char place in town, used to be able to get a table without reservations, but now after getting their Michelin Bib Gourmand recommendation, a phone reservation is required. Must order dishes are  their Big Prawns Horfun, Claypot YongTauFoo, bitter gourd pork ribs and Claypot Chicken.
Food serving size is good but all dishes are very salty, lots of MSG. Take note U will get charged for plain water as well.
I love the horfun. The wokhei and flavours are SO rich. Love it!
Umami!
Very disappointing today when  me and my husband had lunch at Kok Sen restaurant. Food was lukewarm. We ordered 3 dishes and by the time the 3rd dish arrived, my other 2 dishes were completely cold.  Having said so, the sweet and sour pork …
The food was all very well prepared.  Especially enjoyed the yong tau foo and kung Pao frog.  Sweet and sour pork was so-so.  Good Singaporean food and a little less so for Cantonese.  I highly recommend and you cannot beat the location!
Long queue. Prawn hor fun worth ordering. Har cheong gai was average. More pricey for a zichar place due to the location
Food is average nothing spectacular.
This is like a Cantonese style zi char place located near outram park. The food is quite good and they have lo hei here which is excellent for cny! Staff are friendly also and came over for a quick chat Overall really enjoyed the dinner at kok sen!
It&#39;s been a while since we ate here. Now moved further up Keong Saik Road (occupying the shophouse that the famous char siew wonton noodles stall used to be before they closed down last year), with aircon now making dining there much more …
A bit pricey. Horfun was meh. Cereal prawn(de-shelled) was very nice.
Good food and a nice place.
Advice to make reservation coz the queue is so long during dinner time. But when there’s long queue you know that is good food. Price is very reasonable. 1st time and i will be back for other dishes.
Super noisy. People talking loud. Unfortunately interior design didn&#39;t take into account of noise absorption material
Went with my colleagues ( 16 of us) for lunch today. We were rather disappointed with the food quality. Their signature hor fun was bland, prawns shrunk in size. Their other signature yong tau foo was not any better. The sauce was different …
Newly renovated .. food still taste as before .. 👍👍 …
Fall in standard over time. Perhaps new chefs or new kitchen but the signature prawn hor fun was a disaster, first time came watery and bland, asked for sambal for it to be brought behind and have additional sauce but still watery albeit …
Recommended by a friend! There is a very very long queue so if you’re dining in, please make a reservation! …
This place need reservations or u will be queuing for a long time. The place is super compact and super noisy, very hard to even hold a normal conversation as every table are shouting. Not exactly a pleasant experience as your ear will be …
Love this place The Hor fun is so so so good… never disappoint!!! The rest of the food is also good …
Food not bad some dishes are a bit salty. Will patronised again
Food not bad some dishes are a bit salty. Will patronised again
Came here for lunch on CNY eve - our group made reservations but surprisingly we still saw quite a few empty tables. Food was still as good and tasty as ever. Usual must gets are the big prawn hor fun and claypot yong tau foo. We got a …
Booked a table of 10 for cny eve. They have 3 seatings. We had ours at 8pm (last seating). We were delayed n hungry. The kitchen could not send out dishes for those in the 2nd seating. The last seating was therefore pushed to a very late time. Because management is GREEDY to have 3 seatings. Never go back again!!
Yummy local zichar. The dishes were all well-executed, even for a simple broccoli plate. Service is good, and I like that the place is now air-conditioned with comfortable seating. The restaurant is easy to find now that it has relocated. …
Finally I was able to secure a table at this highly sought after restaurant. I took a friend recommendation and ordered the Prawn 🦐 Hor Fun. It is really delicious and tastes a little like Singapore 🇸🇬 Chili Crab gravy. For those who are …
1 hour queue, finally seated and served at 8+. Owner&#39;s son was apologetic that many of the popular dishes have been sold out but still tried his best to recommend. Very good attitude, chatting with the customers. …
Long walk in queue on weekend so best to call and reserve ahead of time. Food quality standards maintained high despite the change of environment into a much more comfortable restaurant with clean tables, floors, air con. Only gripe is the sound bounces around a bit due to multiple surfaces.
Service is atrocious and slow, mixed up our order after an hour wait and tried to force the dish on us
Food is good and affordable but crowds make it difficult to get service staff&#39;s attention and atmosphere is also this often compromised.
Local zichar food. Tasty tho some dishes can be rather salty, overall was wonderful

Good food, will come again!
This restaurant has been a long time favourite of our family, and I am glad that their standard had not dropped. After a long break during which they shifted, we tried their big prawn hor fun (first time for us, we’ve always ordered their …
New place (a few shop down from older place) looks and feel better than the old one. Still same great food. The claypot yong tau foo is one of their signature dish. Fried chicken as well.
Delicious, savory and umami flavors don the tze char dishes here at Kok Send restaurant. Do come early to avoid the crazy queue, and make sure all your guests arrive on time. Food came pretty quickly and service was great.
Service staff were not friendly. Food not up to expectations for a restaurant that has a Michelin 1 star.
Good meal, but couldn&#39;t understand why there&#39;s a long queue for it. None of the dishes were spectularly better than your usual zichar dishes. But maybe because a lot of their signature items were not available that day (like the golden …
Be prepared to wait out if u are visiting during peak hours. Patience is key. But once seated , food is served reasonably fast. The Hor Fun is a must order. If u go by what&#39;s on the wall, those are highly recommended. Great food for the price u pay. Best time to go is weekdays after 8 pm.
Abeit noisy due to rowdt children at next table &amp; low ceiling shop house structure. …
Disappointed with the meal tonight.  Got the big prawn hor fun... But the size and portion of the prawn is sad. Ask …

Unfortunately the quality of the food here has really taken a nose dive after they moved to their new premises. Their signature big prawn hor fun is devoid of the once aromatic wok hei whilst the sauce lacks the usual depth of flavour. The other dishes are uninspired and no different from standard zi char stores but at a 30% premium.
Visited Kok Sen at their new location which is renovated nicely with aircon now. The food are delicious and definitely worth the time to drop by and try. Afterall they are one of the michelin bib gourmand restaurant. Strongly recommend their big prawn hor fun.
4+ stars. Famous Michelin bib gourmand restaurant.  Food quality: …
Food is not so value for money
Food just as delicious. However, still prefer their original site. The new place is nice and well renovated. But being inside amplifies the noise level
Always no crispy skin chicken, had to wait for table even though we booked. Food is great, I’ll be back
I made reservation thru phone and a male staff answered my call. I called again after 3mins coz I wanted to change the time, the female staff said there is no reservation under my name, I was very surprised n she said  maybe the earlier guy …
The standard has dropped a lot. I feel the chef has changed. Oh well.
Have been patronising this shop for years and it has excellent food! Will recommend the big prawn yi mee, beef fried rice, and shrimp paste fried chicken!
Queue a bit during Sunday lunch. Delicious food worth the wait. Super efficient ordering system, food arrived promptly. Every dish was on point, love the old canto style wok hei.
Kok Sen was my top must visit restaurant whenever I travel to Singapore. I visited the new premises for dinner the first time post covid. I was disappointed in the quality of the food. They still have the same menu, the place was completely …
Craving for the prawn hor fun and it did not disappoint. My friend found it a little too spicy but I am loving it. We both enjoyed the Yong Tau Foo and can&#39;t resist sharing a bowl of piping hot white rice to go with it. …
The seafood hor fun is a must try. Period.
I been calling to book but the phone line is always either busy or get cut off by the receiver on the other side.
Might have been biased seeing all the raving reviews, food was decent but not great. Service is poor.
Great food
The food was delicious and tasty but the service can be improved.  We waited patiently for the shop to open to have my dinner but we was make to …
Got the big prawn hor fun and was really good! Prawns were nice and juicy, food had really good wok hei. Do note that they just moved to a new place and seems like logistics has not been ironed out, theyre overwhelmed with orders and severely understaffed which led to really long waiting times.
We had an amazing meal at their recently renovated restaurant. Do note that it’s no longer at the same shop unit, they’ve moved a couple of shops down. Loved every dish we ordered including the Yang zhou fried rice, ngor hiang, sambal prawns, fresh green veggies, dry beef hor fun, and shrimp paste chicken.
Queue forms 30 mins before opening and all tables taken by 12pm opening.  May be hard to find a seat but the food is quite tasty. Full of flavour and lots of ingredients.  Prawn Hor Fun and Yong Tau Fu are quite nice.  The prawn paste chicken tastes good but I thought the texture is too tough.
Just moved down the row to a new aircon location. Prawn hor fun is nice!
Nice, tasty Zhi Cha with good service.  IG: sgfood13 Tiktok: gohht13
Yummy place for zichar. Will be back for more
The popular Yong tau foo quality has dropped. Quality of the prawn rolls is so different, minced meat is not Chucky But just minced paste....does not looked like home made.
Great food and service
The food is great, no doubt about that.  However, I used the restroom and went in after a lady staff member came out of …
Michelin printouts dotted the wall, as recent as 2021. Huge crowds, high expectation. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dishes. Bittergourd pork rib $15 just taste of sweet black sauce overly added, with very …
Great zhi chat esp Prawn kuey teow which is house specialty with wok hei. We had slice fish with bittergourd, yam basket with mixed vegetable, 3 eggs spinach. No reservations and they seat you only when all of are around.
A very popular place. Good to make reservations or be prepared to wait. If your party is not there, they will not let you have a table. You&#39;ll need to have everyone there before getting a table. Very cramp as well. …
Dear Kok Sen Restaurant, what happened to your har cheong kai ( Prawn paste chicken) ? They used to be chunky chicken parts which were juicy and packed with aroma. Today I received a packet of tiny mid-wings that are dry and not tasty at …
Yesterday went to eat I order 3 dishes cost me $46 dollar 0ne plate hor fun (2px) One sai po Yong tau Foo n one hei chor small ...don&#39;t know they overcharge me or not?

Date of Visit : Fri 9 Sep 2022 Time : dinner around 6 …
Food was maybe 4 stars, but got to deduct 1 for the queue. Not worth waiting if there’s a long queue. Also it only accepts cash and a local e-payment thing which is not for tourists.
our to go chinese food restaurant! their big prawn hor fun is my favorite 😍😍 …
Tasty food and friendly staff.
We ate 2 kinds of Hor Fun dishes. The signature hor fun dish was spicy, not to my liking - 3/5. The egg seafood hor fun had subpar seafood 3/5. Prawns were turning bad and tasted off. The kai lan veggie and spinach soup can be rated a 4 out of 5 as it is better than othe zhi char places..

Delicious and reasonably priced food. There was a bit of a wait since we didn’t have a reservation but it was worth it
Food was nice but a bit salty.
All the dishes were ordered were great. My favourites were the prawn hor fun and yong tau foo. Price was okay for the portions we ordered unless you are a very big eater
Everything we got was delicious. This zichar knows what they&#39;re doing.  I&#39;d highly recommend the prawn hor fun, prawn paste fried chicken, and tofu with …
Tzechar was alright.
Food is great! Typical Cantonese fare. Got their prawn ho fun, Kai lan, Kang Kong sambal, minced meat tofu. All dishes yummy 😋 …
Hor fun needs more flavour.
Ordered 月光河 &amp; big prawn noodles. The hor fun was disappointing, lacked wok hei &amp; finesse. Pork lard too chunky, shld be cut smaller and fried crispy. I have tasted better prawn noodle.
The restaurant can sit around 11 tables so there is a persistent long queue outside because everyone is waiting for a seat. …
Crispy chicken is good But hor fun not very nice. Hor fun are all stick together in one big chunk. Anyway taste are all ok.
Delicious food  …
Waited at the entrance for 25 mins. Food was ready a long time ago but they just threw my order on the table without informing it was ready. Only when I went to enquire then they took it from the table. It was cold already
Skip the har cheong gai (prawn paste chicken), moonlight horfun, kangkong, and lime(?) juice... Can&#39;t believe all four I ordered were bad lol.... &lt;/3

Messed up our orders (gave us squid instead of prawns) and took more than half an hour for food to arrive. Taste was good though.
Nice food
Cantonese fare.  We have the prawn cantonese fried noodles.  A little different from the other canto fried noodles in SEA as its darker and is ever so slightly spicy. They provide both red cut chilli 🌶  and green pickled chili. If you want …
The food is good! The restaurant does not have acoustic mitigations, the inside of the restaurant is really noisy when it is fully occupied. You can choose to sit outside the restaurant.
Gets quite thirsty after a while.

Kok Sen is a household name among Zhi Char fans. I have heard so much about this place and finally went to Kok Sen for dinner. They don’t take reservations so go at your own risk. We arrived before 6 pm and managed to secure a table for 2. …
Top class of zhi char in Spore with reasonable valuable price...will visit again
Haven been here for some time decided to come back here again to try the dishes. Am quite satisfied that the food is still of standard and the consistency hasn&#39;t …

Got here slightly before 7pm and they don’t accept reservations for 2pax so we ended queuing. There was only 2 tables in front of us but restaurant were letting in all the reserved ones. We ended up waiting 1 hour just to go in and another …
If ya guys wanna try different taste for hor fun! Come down here!  Price $19 (Small) good enough for 2 paxs worthy ! The prawn super fresh ~ …
The queue was quite long, but still consider manageable for a famous restaurant. Make sure you have all member of your parties gathered before you stand on the queue, unless the uncle won&#39;t give you a seat. …
I ordered claypot beancurd and the golden dragon chicken The chicken is 40 bucks and 20 plus for beancurd. Plus delivery is 89 dollars in total. The chicken is such a scam. Is 40 bucks for fried fish cakes with 2 …
Took an hour to serve all our food (3 dishes only). Moreover, +/- 15mins in between which means you have to finish your food one by one. A restaurant which suitable for ‘takeaway’ only.
Great food. Remember to reserve the tables in advance if more than 4 pax!
The food seemed packed with salt and MSG. It may be tasty but overly salty. We ordered 6 dishes and it was $200!
Big prawn noodles, hor fun with lots of wok hei, yong tau fu, prawn paste chicken and lettuce were all delicious and yummy. One of the best zi char around.
Good food, good people. Recommended to bring our friends ther …

Second time to this place and quite disappointed with them. Their dishes are very salty and with heaps of MSG.. The roasted pork stir fried with kailan seems overnight and the roasted skin is soft! Terrible roast pork which is very …
The food is very very nice. Excellent. No horse run.
I feel upset. Today I waited my food exactly 1 hour. No one explained why my food delayed and even one employee ignored when i asked. After 50 minutes from going in, i really wanted to get out of this restaurant. My plan was messed up. The food was not bad but service was awful. They even didn&#39;t accept credit card, i don&#39;t know why.
It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been back and I&#39;ve forgotten how good this ZhiChar place is. …

Mother of all Hor Funs
Good food and decent price.
1+ hour queuing time
Small dish and a bit costly. Food is quite salty but based on personal taste.
Ordered the big prawn horfun, HK noodle, 3 egg spinach, prawn paste chicken, braised salted fish brinjal. Overall taste is above average, horfun and noodle is very good... However all dishes is abit to the saltier side. Some ppl prefer.. …
Good environment, friendly staff and good food... reasonably priced too
Ordered their signature big prawn (hor fun replaced by Yee Mee and was a gastronomic surprised! Seriously love this Yee mee over the usual hor fun. Thought it was gonna be soggy but no, it tasted really good with the sauce! Noodles has that …

Excellent food and Great value
12pm just nice came in when opening. Every staff were very friendly. Ordered a $12 plate of Hor Fun and small cabbage. The taste and quality were superbly fantastic. Aspecially the squid were thick slices,  prawns reasonably medium in size. …
Really delicious Hor Fun (great wok hey) and Claypot Yong Tau Foo! Price point is slightly on the higher side, more expensive than most zichar places.
Good taste and overall food quality is good.
food was average, service was slow, q was long. if u cme ard dinner time from 6-7, be prep to wait for long time. aft 8 will be OK.
Very different from the normal hor fun. Super shiok. Crowds is still there even during Covid-19 and I&#39;m not surprise at all. Good location to grab my crossiant at keong saik bakery ❤️
Tofu dis …
Just sharing my experience this evening. Opens at 5pm. Arrived 20mins early and was 3rd in line. While waiting that, I believe the cooks were already cooking for take-out …
Excellent dinner tonite at this Cantonese zhi char restaurant. The big prawn horfun, claypot yong tau foo, and  prawn paste chicken are yummy. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity. Like the service too!
Saw the 2021 Bib Gourmand label when walking past looking for a dinner in the area. So we immediately sat down at one of the tables on street level and ordered some random dishes from the menu. So here is what I can say: …
The fish is so fresh and refreshing to add vegetables around the fresh fish. Thanks so much for a great lunch
Good food a bit pricy but good quality selections
Up next on the Michelin Bib Gourmand Singapore 2021 List, a visit was made to Kok Sen Restaurant. Located on Keong Saik Street, this restaurant is your typical Zhi Char place with a slight improvement on flavour and price as well. …
Always loved their Sam Lo! The price about 8 but it’s worth every dollar and calories ! I ate this on my own ! Quality of the slice fish was fresh and generous . Value for the money
Probably one of the best beef hor fun in sg
I ate stir-fried food with large shrimp and flat noodle …
Food was excellent!
The big prawn hor fun is unique and full of umami. Not the usual hor fun that you would expect.  However it’s a little too oily for my liking.
Very good seafood clay pot and fried chicken.
Good food and serve quickly
The place is crowded with customers be they be dinibgwithin the restaurant or along the 5 foot way. The crowds come in a constant manner as tgey seem to be regular customers. …
The sliced fish and bitter gourd with black bean sauce is delicious. Black bean sauce is fragrant with nice wok hei, mixed well with the bitter gourd and sliced fish. Other dishes are nice as well.
too overpriced 19 for 2 cut up large prawns and flavourless claypot tofu. fish soup was so so. bill came up to 42 dollars for 3 dishes, all small.
Read a lot of good reviews and brought my parents to try out their food. Place was supposed to open at 5pm for dinner. We ended up waiting outside till 5.15pm before we could finally enter. There were already quite a number of people …
Good zhi char. Aircon, clean and spacious seating. Service was quite prompt and no nonsense. Above average price. Always packed, reservation recommended.
Highly recommended by a friend. Ordered take away. Waited for an hour. Others who came after us were served their food first. Not even an apology. Food was average. A sadly disappointing experience. Would not patronise this establishment again.
40+ minute wait for two dishes to take away. Not going back.
Awesome Cantonese food. Queue move abit slow during lunch time. Be prepared to pay a little more.
Came for weekday lunch and there was no queue but it was pretty crowded. The big prawn hor fun is the crowd&#39;s favorite and I understand why. The gravy is really thick and you will get 4 huge chunks of prawn. However, I notice that their …
Great service, clean and authentic. Not overly seasoned . Love the beef hor fun
The go to place for comfort chinese food with the wok kei taste!
Tasty zi char in the heart of Chinatown. The portion is big, hence 3 dishes for 2 is enough. The prawn here are sooo big and satisfied to bite. The lady who noted our order is very friendly and attentive. A bit pricey though.
This is my first visit here. Ordered the prawn paste chicken (big), big prawns hor fun (small), fried red snapper and pork. I like the fish and the big prawns hor fun. You can bring your own alcohol with $10 corkage fee. This is not bad but …
Great food (on the salty side, but that’s how I like it) with subpar service. Despite what they told me on the phone, they DO take reservations. Prepare yourself for both a delicious meal and to be rudely shouted at. I recommend the Prawn Horfun.
Old school yummy Tze Char place. Glad I found this place! Yong Tau Foo is unique. Try it!
Old school yummy Tze Char place. Glad I found this place! Yong Tau Foo is unique. Try it!
Was super crowded on a Thursday nite. Prices aren’t outrageous, but the food was soso. Prawn Hor Fun was Shiok but the rest of the stuff I had was soso.
Quality has definitely dropped quite a bit compared to just a year and a half ago. We&#39;ve tried both dine in and delivery a couple of times for fair comparison, and the overall taste is a lot plainer, har cheong kai is sharper in saltiness, …
Went on 26/11 with my frenz, food nothing to wow about. average standard. service average too, particularly one guy who was practically waiting for us to leave per se, when I walked out, there was no q at all. I stayed in the North area, if I happen to pass by, maybe will drop by. I won&#39;t travel all the way. Not worth my time.
One of the best prawn hor fun I must say. It&#39;s super flavourful and slightly spicy. …
Loved the old world charm.  Food was great,  service not too bad, priced a little steep for dishes,  but generally a nice place to have a meal with your family or friends.
Food is nice but a bit pricy.
Food is as good as usual but seriously packed (esp. after CB). Very local canto style of cooking. One of my fave place for dinner over 20yrs!
I have very bad experience with this restaurant. I order their special chicken and waited for 30-45 min. In the end they told me the chicken is finish and they didn&#39;t saw my order. Very disappointed on their services. Will not go this restaurant again.
Covid. No queue. So decided to pop in good a quick lunch. Had my usual black bean beef horfan. Lacks wok-hei and a tad too sweet. Sgd7 is affordable but kinda pfff.....
One of my fav cze char shop in SG. Ordered fried fish, clay pot Yong tofu, claypot kam heong chicken, sambal belacan kangkong &amp; sliced fish hor fun with bean sprout. Everything is good save for …
Their prawn hor fun has to be one of my favorite things to eat in Singapore. The prawn paste chicken is pretty good too, and the chili that comes with it packs a punch. Can get super crowded on Friday/Saturday evenings, so either come early around 5-ish, or book in advance!
Very good czechar, with some dishes almost restaurant quality. Ask if they have anything fresh or special to recommend (check price 1st). Their claypot dishes are good and don&#39;t miss the Prawn Horfun. Expect higher than usual czechar prices.
5 Stars for Food 1 Star for Service Takeaway If you read the reviews, most agree that the food is good. However if you read about service related to takeaway, it is not good. …
Great nostalgic czechar dishes
Delayed our delivery order by 1 hour+ then when the time came, they cancelled the order. On top of that the grab driver went to collect and was played out. *update* ty for your reply but grab has concluded that kok sen cancelled the order. Furthermore I made the order at lunch for dinner.
Not food related but with regards to delivery as I had accepted their orders thru oddle and was cancelled 5 times in a row for the last 2 months. Called up and was told customer decided to collect themselves, 1 time maybe but 5 times??? …

Very very slow service.
Taste great. Very wok hei. Lousy order management though.
Super crowded and tight seatings. The food tasted normal and not sure why the craze for the over priced food. There are better Zhi Char stalls nearby say Chinatown Complex or Maxwell Hawker.
Old school Canton food that easily withstood the test of time. Good wok hei, great savoury notes and texture. Overall very delicious except that it&#39;s slightly pricey. However, easily a local&#39;s favourite
Waste of time theres a difference between doing online orders and dine ins. I wouldnt mind queueing because the place had no space to sit because customers were eating but i waited 1hr+ Looking at takeaway order fly past me without having anything sent out of the kitchen. Imagine having the entire restaurant have empty tables
Gets carried away cooking takeaways. For the time queued food isnt worth it. Tr@sh
Again is a Michelin guide that don&#39;t really impressed... After many tried of others Michelin guide foods, need to conclude the White really don&#39;t understand/ know Asian foods... Not that this Kok Sen is bad but when it comes to Zi char …
Always lovely to eat here with old school yummy tze Char! Phoenix chicken is a rare dish here and definitely a Specialty! Delectable!
Old school Cantonese cuisine with good wok hei! Try coming at 8.30pm onwards which is less crowded. But do note that their last order is at 9.30pm.
Excellent!
Michelin worthy indeed. The wokhey in the prawn horfun was crazy, and prawns were huge too. Their claypot YTF had the most flavourful filling too. My go-to for tzechar. Never disappoints!
Kok Sen serves good ole zichar. Their claypot yong tai foo is superb and the claypot kam heong chicken with its sauce goes so well with a bowl of rice.
Didn’t need to wait for a table when we arrived. Service was great and food tasted awesome. Only downside is the waiting time for food to be served as they were very busy. Otherwise it was a really satisfying meal and we’ll be back to try other dishes again.
Worst tasted food 2021. Can’t swallow! The 4 dish was just not eatable.
Tasty food
What is wrong with this zi-char!?!  Rude people serving mediocre food. Old uncle who sits at the front is super annoying and rude, and shouted mean comments when i asked about the food. Waited 1.5hours and was told to wait some more.
Had their black bean beef horfun, hokkien prawn mee (black) and the kangkong.  I liked the black bean beef horfun as it comes with lots of sauce and the beef …
Overly over-rated !!! Food nothing to shout about, just so so only. Dishes can be very salty at times. The old uncle sitting at the front of the shop collecting cash payments from customers is Very Rude and thinks there&#39;s no better zichar or cooked food shop than his shop !!!
It&#39;s the food memories and history of the place that makes you go back again and agian
I’ve been here a few times with my friends pre-pandemic, and I really liked the food. I decided to order takeaway today since I was in the area. I really wanted to like it this time round too. But the wait turned out to be more than an hour …
One of the Titans of the local Zhi Char scene, Kok Sen has become a mainstay for office workers looking for amazing Zhi Char after work. In particular, their Ampang style Yong Tau Foo, Fermented Bean Lettuce, and Black Sauce Chicken are my …
Moonlight horfun is good but the big prawn hor fun is even better with chilli! Silky and luscious, it’s a very satisfying meal. The rest of the dishes are quite good too. Can call to ask for a reservation.
Nice Zi Char store. The seafood is fresh and they are generous with their portions.
Cantonese cooking like fried hoy fan. Reasonable prices for food.
Is the small portion of the signature Big Prawn Hor Fun meant for one person or two? Love the taste, but disappointed with the serving of hor fun, which was barely enough for a grown man, let alone two adults, for which previous reviewers …
One of my fav go to joints for casual zi char. Decided to takeaway during this no dine in period - my fav big prawn noodle soup and the eggplant in Claypot with minced tofu. So satisfying ! Burp!
I order prawn paste chicken..when arrived the container they&#39;re using is half open... they purposely cut it open to air it out.. but for me it&#39;s not hygienic like this..coz they put it only in a plastic bag and half open? Huh? Really? You …
Ordered via grab pick up, went to check on the status of my food but order weren&#39;t ready and I was also 10 minutes earlier than the stated time. Went back to the car and wait as the crowd waiting were already more than 5 pax, didn&#39;t want to …
Not been there for at least 18 months. Place has become smaller and tables spaced out very nicely. Seems like the tables along the back alley are gone. Quite easy to get a table as the turnover is rapid. …
Thanks for providing such great dishes, the wok hey is superb!! Portion is very big for one person, perfectly seasoned, just too much hor fun, and the beef slice can slightly abit thicker, otherwise perfect. Looking forward for the next visit!
Very good Claypot Yong Tau Foo, Crispy Chicken, Salted Fish Pork and Big Prawn Horfun. The uncle sitting close to the entrance took COVID-19 safety measures very seriously 👍🏽 …
Just renovated for a wider setup but gets extremely busy on weekends, so dont expect quality service. Decent portions with excellent flavours. Parking is a nightmare.
Pretty disappointed, over rated though only thing I find is the prawn are fresh, other than that all the other dishes are serious mediocre, lousier or on par with normal coffee shops zi char store.  Waited 1 hour for the foods and folks …
Very tasty. Not very cheap but very tasty.
Values for money good foods
Very bad customer service, especially the old uncle. He is very rude and scolded people for not saying the order despite repeated many times. This is not first time such attitude received. If he cannot be bothered, don&#39;t sit there to receive customer.  Customer will just walk away.
Lousy taste and poor portions, only the prawn soup is decent but you&#39;re paying $20 for it
The prawn horfun is not bad
Avoid peak hours, full of people! Food quality is good. Normal Zi char price. Friendly staff.
Great food for reasonable price. However the mobile connection inside the premises is lousy. Cannot receive phone call , sms or WhatsApp.
Great good. Must try
Prawn Hor Fun and Yong Tau Foo are very yummy with the former full of wok hei. Fillings of the yong tau foo comprise more than merely fish paste, with a hint of squid &amp; prawn paste soaked in flavourful sauce.  I was hesitant initially …
I would really like to thanks Kok Sen Restruant very much for this thoughtful gift for my dad ! I actually ordered their famous Big Prawn Hor Fun for my dad&#39;s birthday to eat with our colleagues and requested for more portion of Hor Fun as …
Kok Sen Restaurant (國成球記餐室) is a great, old-school, no frills and reasonably priced Zi Char restaurants that many Singaporeans consistently flock to each day to get their fix. Now into its third generation, the Wong family has been serving …
Standard Zichar food.  Cash payments only.
This tze char restaurant is truly deserving of its Michelin bib gourmand status! We got the following: 1. Big prawn noodle(but was actually hor fun?? $18): came with 4 HUMONGOUS …
Authentic chinese/cantonese food. Might need to wait a bit during peak hours.
All dishes are meh but what was good (just good but not woah) is their prawn hor fun
love the hor fun. just order that. the rest - average, to be honest. …
Good food. Very crowded operating hours is from 12pm
📍 Kok Sen Restaurant, 30B Keong Saik Road ⭐️ @michelinguide Tze char! Golden dragon chicken 🐉 🐓 only available on Friday and weekends, signature big prawn hor fun ✨ …
Great food and fast service, only bad thing is long queues. But I guess it can&#39;t be help cause they are good.
Excellent food always, staff is rather attentive and pleasant.
It was the first time I visited the restaurant. The food tasted great and the price was also reasonable. Will definitely go back.
Came back to this restaurant again after CB period. It was during CNY period hence yu sheng was offered rather pricey, $60 with only jelly fish 😅 and some veg please check price before ordering it.  Add on abalone for $20. …
Good food but not cheap
Good food but not cheap
One of my favourite zhe char (Chinese a la carte) restaurants in Singapore. Kok Sen really earn their place in Michelin Bib Gourmand, and it&#39;s a great place if you are looking for rich &amp; strong flavour Chinese food. Must-order dishes are the prawn hor fun, prawn bee hoons and crispy chicken. Just simply amazing.
In terms of the food taste and quality, it is easily a five star restaurant. Prawns are definitely fresh and the sauce from the hor fun packs a good punch with a little heat, unlike anything else out there. …
Certainly the numbo uno zi char place in town,consistent great cantonese dishes to savour on...marvelicious big prawns noodles,those who like pork lard yo go with the ho fun,go for it,never missed its wok hei,claypot yong tau foo,ha cheong …
I tried the big prawn hor fun and Yong tau foo. Won&#39;t say it is the best but still tasty
Always craving a good large prawns hor fun and prawn paste chicken!
Ordered via whatsapp, response was fast. I was able to change my order a day before as some of my friends are not able to turn up. On the day of collection, they called to inform my food was ready. It was on time. Not late. …

Good tze-char place in town
No parking space....super long waiting time. Not worth the trouble
Excellent food! Better make reservations or you may need to wait for a while.
Highly recommend
was ok...the horfun was the main highlight!
Michelin quality food at great value!
Kok Sen is great. One of the best tze char places in SG. Food is really awesome - I typically order their homemade tofu, salt and pepper prawn, and black pepper beef. All taste fantastic, and I probably should try some of their other …

Tasty authentic food. Every dish a flavour bomb.
Great food at very affordable prices. Good dessert places all within the vicinity.
Came over for dinner and ordered their signature dishes such as roasted chicken,  fried yam basket with seafood, spinach with 3 eggs in seafood broth, seafood Hor fun and Fujian Ee mee. Firstly, there was a queue and the restaurant was …
Not sure what the fuss is all about with the yong tau foo, it is overly salty and greasy. Not expecting any good service for the price point but the dishes although may be popular on instagram, are really nothing to shout about.
Good tze char place. Flavours are reliably what they ought to be (fishcake stuffing is bouncy, prawn noodle stock is prawny etc), kinda like what we all used to expect a decent tze char to be but which is so hard to find these days. The …
The food here is Top Class and the price is quite reasonable.
The crispy noodle with shrimp omelette was absolutely amazing. The best I ever had. …

We got the food delivered and it remained amazing. Consistently good food =&gt; wonderful for family gathering! Highly recommend the fried rice and minced pork tofu.
First time here, Service was exceptionally bad, workers were extremely impolite and super impatient! Will never come back again!
The prawn noodle in medium is huge but tasty! A place that I frequent often during my childhood. It never disappoints me.
food so so...too pricey...young male boss too arrogant and pompous....young boss talks without even looking at you...waiting time of 1 hr (20 mins in Q and 40 mins at the table) just not worth it...
Oh, it&#39;s exciting, it&#39;s really delicious Prawn beef soup soup is addictive H …
Yummy food, but extremely horrible customer service. When the door opened at 12pm, they seat all the dine-in customers while totally ignoring the take-away customers, though the take-away customers came first. If you are looking for a great experience, avoid this place.
Legit Singaporean Chinese meal. Giving it 4 stars because there&#39;s no chili crab when we ate there
Very long queue
Honestly think the food is average for the Q. What i like most is the har cheong gai, chicken is fresh. But the beef hor fun is a bit too burnt for my liking. Claypot yong tau foo so so even though i saw every table had ordered one 😅 veg is fresh. …
Was impressed a couple of years ago but the standard has dropped drastically. All the dishes I ordered, including their popular big prawn horfun was lukewarm at best. Any other random zichar place would be better. Don&#39;t understand why …
Tradition zhu zhou with wok hey. Good services and delicious food. Must try seafood hor fun.
One of the best hot fun in Singapore. Easily the top 3. Also, a place to go for fresh wild-caught prawns. The prawn soup bee hoon was also full of flavour. The taste tends to be on the stronger side of things and both dishes are slightly spicy.
When there for an early dinner at 540pm and sure enough, the queue starts forming at 6pm. The food is good and the fish is fresh. A little bit pricey but overall a good dining experience.
Good food but not worth the price point, you can find other places that serve better food with affordable prices.
We got the prawn hor fun and the stir fried beef with spring onions. They were both fantastic. Generous portions. Plan to go back again.
liked their big prawn horfun and claypot yong tau foo. other dishes are mediocre
Always long queue, do not recommend. Food taste ok, however the waiting time makes your anger grow more and more, the owner even chase away customer who come alone because they rather serve customer in a group for more profit. No no for me.
Excellent food at reasonable prices. Tough to get a table unless you get there early. Service is great!
Good food, value for money. Prepare for long waiting in queue and food. Be patience, its worth the wait
Good amount of wok hey in the dishes but really pricey.
Very good Chinese food Recommend
Ok no surprises
Really a disappointment...  Not my efforts time here but my first experience here 3 years ago was definitely …

Lived up to its reputation for zhi char. Be prepared to queue. Very fresh steamed garoupa, fermented bean curd fried romaine lettuce, the must try claypot yong tau foo, black bean sauce fried bitter gourd with pork ribs, and pepper sauce beef hor fun.
Michelin star/ Cantonese food. Atmosphere manicured to look like an coffee shop. Staff friendly. Presentation good.
food taste was really good. i ordered broccoli with pork, broccoli really fresh and a bit smell smoky but its nice. second i ordered fried chicken with prawn sauce if im not mistaken.. again this chicken so juicy and delicious. regarding the price hmm a bit expensive tho but overall still very recommended. enjoy :)
The wok hei on the fried rice is really good
Superb nice food!
Poor service. Expensive food.
Went on a Saturday evening, the queue was long as usual. We queued for an 1hr before we can get a seat. Personally, I felt the standard has dropped a bit. Claypot yong tau fu is a must!
Food was really tasty. However, queue moved very slowly. Took more than an hour to get seated. And almost another hour for the 3 dishes ordered to be served. Each dish came about 10 minutes apart from each other. …
Tasty, generous portions of all the dishes blended with rich &#34;gu zao wei&#34; (taste of olden times especially the sea food hor fun) …
Food is good and delivery is punctual
Came to this restaurant after watching Mark Wiens&#39;s VLOG on this restaurant. Reached here at 5pm but the restaurant has not open yet. There were many people waiting in front of the shop. …
Word of warning: Prepare to wait. Queue can get rather long.  Big prawn hor fun is good. Strong wok hei with distinct gravy paired with fresh prawns.
love their food. Almost every time when there is any friend come visit in sg, i will bring them to this local restaurant.
One of my favourite place for Hor fun
The ladies recommend a sweet and sour fish cost $60 with fishy smelly taste. And never disclose price when we order. Feedback when make payment, get reply is - fish all come with fishy smell. …
The ladies recommend a sweet and sour fish cost $60 with fishy(smelly) taste. Feedback when make payment, get reply is - fish all come with fishy (smelly). We get to know the fish price when make payment. $60 can eat more x10 better fish. …
Tried the big prawn hor fun and was disappointed.... its has abit wok hei taste but its just prawn hor fun with spiciness in it....nothing great about it. …
Service can be chaotic and hurried but that&#39;s a result of the popularity.  Flavors are great here.  Five stars if it weren&#39;t for the service.
Felt the taste isn&#39;t the same anymore.
Second visit here after visiting on a Monday the previous time around when they weren’t opened. …
Great food! Go and eat in a bigger group so you can try more of their dishes. However, be prepare for the bill 😅. Kok Sen Restaurant serves quality food at above average prices - some of us may find it expensive. Service staff is attentive, …

My favorite Zi Char place in Singapore.
Decent zi char outfit right smack in the middle of town. The food was good, but not impressive. I felt like it trended along the average levels in Singapore&#39;s zi char scene. A tad pricey, but you&#39;ve great location for good local food …
The food is delicious, but ordering may …
Great zi char dishes, great price! Come earlier on weekends to avoid queueing!  I ordered four dishes to share when I dined here. …

Staffs are rude. Food served cold. Clearly overrated.
cheat money. recommend dishes without letting us know of the price. esp when it was $60+?

Nice Caton style zichar. First time trying and am already sure will be back again.
Food is tasty but comes with a price.
My sister and bil had raved about the prawn horfun so we decided to order it for a family get together. While I thought the horfun was average and not worth the hype, my sister and bil were appalled by how salty it was. They have had it …
The food is so delicious! Every dish is very surprising, the door opens at 12 o&#39;clock, and there are al …
BEST WOK CHI in Town.
Local zichar. Fresh. Reasonable priced.
First-timers must order the big prawn hor fun! Nothing ordinary or generic about its taste. The wok hei and spiciness of the eggy sauce elevates this staple zi char dish. No one else does it like them 🙆 …
Overrated and slow service
Black pepper …
Good canto fare, clean environment.
Food great, but completely disorganized. Woman must have bagged and rebagged my takeaway order 3 times.
Good Zi char bear cbd. Long queue and sharing of tables is common for smaller groups. Found the big prawn hor fun to be good but not die die must try
A place full of people. Foods not bad and the portion is good too.
Big prawn hor fun is so good and I can&#39;t find it anywhere else in Singapore.
Arrogant and rude. There is no service.  Called at 840pm and was told that their last order would be 915pm. Reached there …
Finally get to pack in from kok sen today. The last time I came by, there was such a long queue that the order taking staff at the shop said I needed to wait at least 1 hour. …
Food is tasty and delicious. Pre-order to minimise a long wait!
Authentic, tasty and lots of choices. The queue is often long so best to go early.

Great! Very tasteful. I didn’t mind waiting because the food is awesome!
A 4.5! One of the best Zi Char in town and a long standing one at that! Kok Sen is so popular and for one obvious reason - the food is THAT good. It is so popular it also requires one to be plan ahead and if not, well, just be patient and …
One of the local restuarants and for me it is post drinking place. Food is good and pretty decent and cheap. I love this food post a long night drinking session and it is comfort food. If you haev never done this in ISngpaore then need to …
Good food. Value for money.
Nice food but I think it’s pretty much like the normal Tze char except for the prawn Hor fun. That’s my favourite among the dishes we ordered. Their pork ribs were soft and tender too👍🏻 …
Come here often with family. Quality is quite consistent.

Food is not bad, long queues so better call and reserve in advance. A little on the expensive side though.
superb food! but come during odd timings or you might be caught in an hour or longer queue
Fantastic food and service
Popular Zi Char store, come early to avoid the queue. The highlight Big prawn horfun was tasty, spicy though, not suitable for non spicy eaters. Rest of the dishes were well cooked,  crispy shrimp paste chicken was a tad too salty in my opinion.
Fine soft shell crab and we were the only non Chinese in a packed restaurant
Nice hor fun with work hei taste!
High volume of custom

A Zi Char restaurant along the popular Keong Saik Road serves typical Cantonese cuisine - claypot dishes, Chicken fish cake, Yam in basket, fried Hor fun and veggies. It&#39;s jam pack with young diners as the food service is swift and comes piping hot in a wave minutes after your order is placed.
Awesome Food
Everything was really good albeit slightly salty (and I love salt!). Get their yong tau foo and prawn hor fun - there’s a reason basically every table orders it. I like that you can get items in 3 different sizes, as 2 people it helped so …

So much has been said about this great zhichar place in Keong saik road. I’ll let the pics speak for itself. …

Horfun is tasty
Good and reasonable
Came here on Foodking&#39;s recommendation, and I must say it&#39;s really Foodking good. Definitely do expect a wait if you come at peak periods. We had to wait about 45 mins. Overall the taste of the dishes were exceptional. The prawn hor fun was …
Great home cooked Chinese food. The big prawn hor fun and claypot yong tou fu must try!
V flavourful prawn horfun.  For those who like it less spicy can ask for the chef to reduce its spiciness
Food is good. The bestsellers are really worth the title but the crowdedness makes it a little uncomfortable.
Excellent food at reasonable prices. Tough to get a table unless you get there early. Lunch is easier than dinner. Service is great!!
Value for money and good service.
Dishes were interesting and above average. Price was ok. Service was ok only.
Claypot Yong Tau Foo, Big Prawn Hor Fun, Prawn Paste Chicken, Homemade Tofu with Minched Pork. Having earn its much deserved bib gourmand only meant more crowds but thankfully the food standard is still as good.
Jam packed because of the food.
Amazing place worth queuing for
Nice
The signature prawn fried hor fun (rice noodles) is definitely a must try. It has great “wok hei” and a very unique gravy that’s not found anywhere else. The claypot Yong Tau Fu is another great dish with a unique cooking style here. The …
Been craving to have dinner here for quite a while, and decided to have an impromptu visit. Long queue as usual, and great taste as expected. Their Big Prawn Hor Fan is just awesome!!! 😋👍🏻 …
Enjoyable big prawn hor fun, has spice in it. Well balanced spinach soup dish!
Good food at reasonable prices
Ate lunch here with 2 of our Singaporean friends. This is definitely a local lunch spot - the venue was packed, though we were able to get a table fairly quickly around 1:00PM. …
Recently gained fame through the review from food king.  Food was okay, nothing special. Queue was long, and the service took too long.
Always go to place when we are in Singapore
No frills zhichar place with very delicious food. The prawn horfun is special with intense flavour, the gravy reminds me of chilli crab. The claypot YTF is nice too and I can taste prawn and sotong in the paste. Highly recommend for delicious food. For me the pricing is reasonable because it is delicious.
Excellent food quality, reasonable prices however expect longer waiting period during peak hours, no ambience just enjoy your meal.
Tasteless and over price.. Ordered 10 dish only 2 are nice the rest is waste of money.. And their Michelin star had been taken off

Very yummy Zi char
Yummy yummy yummy and yummy. That&#39;s all I can say.
Big prawn hor fun is the best
Aiya one of the best zhi shar around here to Chinatown!! Best for fresh steam fish, young tau foo, and their big prawn soup or dry noodles! Yummy. Still trying out other selections after many years.. enjoy
Tried the signature horfun. Very savory with large prawns. The claypot tofu was a little oily. Loved the bitter gourd with pork ribs, soft and tasty. Overall the food here is very savory with lots of sauce and will go well with rice.
Over rated!
The Yong to Fu and the prawn noodles are highly recommended.

Ordered the smallest portion of Prawn Hor Fun ($18), which can feed about 2-3 person. The taste is really quite different from what you will eat from other zi char store, it’s filled with aromatic wok hey and a little bit of spice. The …

Good zi char with wok hei.
Warm but good food
Long wait for the food but quality is not bad. Worth a try but be prepared for some time before u can enjoy them!
Tasty food at reasonable priced
We ordered the small size and ended up at the end of the meal they charged us the large size(possibly because they can tell we&#39;re tourist), out of the bunch of the staff there was only one to two nice women who took our order and ask if we …

We had local friends take us here and order for us. The food is amazing and so fresh. The place is busy and there was a little wait but totally worth it. Prices are so fair. The tables are family style so you might share and meet new friends. You can walk around Chinatown after dinner if you wish. Really cool area!
Great prawn horfun and Yong tau foo. Vegetable was nice as well. Price on the higher side but worth to try at least once to decide if it&#39;s value for money for you!

This place is very popular with the locals. Fresh ingredients and reasonable price. My favourites are Prawn noodle, deep fried frog with ginger, yam ring, and steam fish.
Beside the lady on my photo, don’t bother to ask anyone else to take your order or ask any questions. Either the language barrier (but I speak Chinese) or lack of knowledge or they are just serving staff or they are simply short or stafF. …
Great food but poor customer service. They lack manpower to cater all the customers. I hope they can do something about it.
Must try the prawn mee!
Must come 30 minutes earlier as this is the estimation time you will be queueing for. And then must wait for another 30-45 minutes until you first dish is being served. Foods are delicious though. If you are not in rush, can consider visit and grab a dinner!
I order a big prawn hor fun for SGD18. The prawn is quite big and I remember around 3-4 in this plate. The prawn is fresh but I cannot feel much prawn flavor? The best is that the hor fun is so perfectly caramelized with so much wok hey …
Very delicious rice noodles with prawns and eggs. The taste is smoo …
Excellent zichar place. Kok Sen is famous for their big prawn horfun and yong tau foo so definitely give it a try! The horfun is special as the sauce is pretty similar to that of chilli crab.  Can get very crowded during dinner time so expect to wait at least 30 minutes before you’re seated.
Don’t understand why so many queue for the insane food. Food are salty not my type.
Super tasty food, don&#39;t judge by the interior (or the lack of anything resembling it), incredibly tasty!
Good food!
Very authentic and great food. Highly recommend
Food was all yummy and prices reasonable but many of their dishes were sold out by the time we got there for dinner around 7pm on a Saturday night.
Price is reasonable, worth to eat
If you&#39;re craving good zichar then this is definitely the place!

The big prawn hor fan is worth every calorie! The wok hei smell is amazing! The sat evening queue is manageable with very prompt service.
Very packed with a Long wait.  Food was fantastic - would recommend the beef hor fun, the fermented lettuce, and the prawn spicy soup
Excellent food
Certain dishes are nice , the rest are normal. Braised tofu not reccomended.

Food is good but waiting time is long to get a table.

Nice but slow and $$
Unpretentious local food in hippie area. Cheap and good. Prawn noodles a must!!!
Been back multiple times for the big prawn hor fun!
Great tze-char!
Great tasting traditional Chinese dishes!
Tasty local cuisine, price reasonable, recommend to everyone who likes chinese cuisine
The signature prawn horfun (rice noodles) is excellent! Make reservations because it gets really popular during peak service.
Great place with amazing food
This  was  a  good  restaurant  .  The  prices  for  food  are  reasonable . I  strongly  recommend  it  for  a  good  meal .
A traditional Chinese style place with dishes still yummy for all generations. My favourite is their claypot Yong tau foo😋😋😋 …
Waited for very long just to experience very poor service from this restaurant. 1. Rude service staff 😤 2. 3 groups sharing table😟 …
Been eating at this place for more than 10 years. Quality of food is good.
I had a simple lunch get together with some friends. We order 7 dishes, and all dishes are exceptional good. Out amazements is the price/pax is very affordable consider its a proper restaurant and high service level. Definitely highly recommended and I will come back again.
Very decent food. My favorite is the prawn hor fun. Order a large for a group of 4 guys and skip the rice. It would be perfect. The other dishes are relatively well prepared. A signature dish, chicken skin with “seafood”, it is basically chicken skin with a fish cake below.
Perfect for breakfast &amp; grab-go meals. They offer pao too👍 …
These 3 were very nice! Hor fun, beehoon and Yong Tau Foo!
I love all the food here.
Saucy goodness! My third visit here, and it was better than my last. Ordered the standard prawn horfun, new dishes today are yong toufu and braised fried fish and bittergourd in dark sauce. …
Excellent food, service is not the best but it&#39;s to be expected. Definitely try the eggplant with minced meat claypot. Absolute perfection
Horfun tastes good but very MSGy, the food is generally expensive.
The hor fan taste great but the prices of all the dishes here are rather high considering its ambience is like any old coffeeshops.
Food is cheap and good! Long queue outside could make you feel a little rushed though.
Ordered the yong tau foo and the prawn horfun. Horfun was delicious, with chopped chilli fried into the sauce, giving it a deliciois spiciness. …

Good food &amp; reasonable price.
good big prawn hor fun
Food taste good. Price very reasonable
Very good Zi Char place. Prawn Hor fun (small$16) is really really good. Prawn is big and fresh. Gravy has a bit hint of chilli crab source. The yong tau foo is not to my taste,unfortunately. …
Always Excellent food quality. Solid Zhu Char dishes
Prices for various dishes are out of the world. Food offers are only ordinary.
Try the Claypot Yong Tau Foo and the Big Prawn Hor Fun. Best in the world.
Excellent sg style zichar
Food is passable. Like most other good zi char. What sets them apart is the constant lousy service and stuck up attitude. So if you can stomach this constant. Do visit!!

All time favorite zhicha restaurant in SG!
Good place for claypot dishes. Cash only
What an incredible place! It&#39;s a throwback to old Singapore. The ambiance is one of an old coffee shop with tile on the walls, the menu written in Chinese, and the food amazingly good. Do try the fish paste chicken. No air conditioning, but it&#39;s worth it to sweat it out here.
Great zichar place. Tried their cereal prawns, claypot yong Tau foo, and big prawns hor fun. Their prawns are generally tasty, but not the dimsum crunchy kind, which is fine. Three dishes came to about 50+ which is fair.
It doesn’t matter if you’ve just had your dinner. One does not walk pass this place and not try out their hor fun! Slurp worthy!
This place is packed and understandably so. The beef is so tender and all their dishes so tasty! Sadly I didn&#39;t have enough stomach space for all the dishes. Also wanted to try their golden dragon chicken balls but it is available only on weekends.
Not bad. Tastes good. But pricey.
Excellent Chinese Zhi Char for economical prices! The Resturant also boast a BYOB policy! But be sure to clean up after you go! Must try’s are the clay pot Yong tau foo, Har cheong kai, curry fish tail and slice fish sum lor Hor fun.
I had the best dinner here during my Singapore trip. Meat rolls and pork chop are my favourites! It&#39;s pretty crowded and busy but service is fast. I will definitely come back again
One of the best zichar in town. May need to wait for seats.
Good value, sufficient wok hei
Been here for a few times, it&#39;s crowded and busy all the time. Their stir fried beef with spring onion and claypot Yong tau Fu are really delicious. It&#39;s a casual spot with affordable price
Wow!! Great Food and really value for money.Very Reasonable price.must try!!#
Great zhi char restaurant. Recommend Yong Tau Foo.
Got 1 of our dishes wrongly and told us we didn&#39;t specify properly, everyone at our table heard the order correctly, only the person who took it heard wrongly. Some dishes were too salty.
the food was really good by all means, but the price for my plate was a bit higher than I exited considering the place itself, you can easily find better quality / comfort / price ratio in this area
The uber delicious chinese restaurant in Kok Sen..prawn paste chicken, spinach, and king prawns are a must try..😋😋😋 …
One of the best zhi char cuisine in Singapore
Been here a couple of times. Owners became audacious after receiving Michelin star. Food used to taste better before. Not worth waiting anymore.
Nice zhu char food....can be crowded.
Nice place nice food
Great food, value for money. Must try their big prawn hor fun, fish soup, Claypot yong tau foo. Har cheong kai also good. Reservations a must.
It was great
Food quality is very high and value for money.
The food is good but not great. The wait is long. The atmosphere is hectic. The furniture is plastic. The family business is booming due to the Michelin starred cafe, so the staff can not cope with the increased flow of customers, because of this, the speed and quality of service  …
Excellent dishes! Love them and will recommend to our friends! Totally a great dinner night out for the 6 of us! …
Did a walk in at around 5.30 pm here. The entire place was already reserved and they opened up a table just for us. …

Cantonese cuisine. Friendly servers. Parking can be a challenge though.
Busy is key word here. No matter how late and which night they are packed. All walks of people and even foreigners are coming here. Guess cos they were awarded the bib gourmand recently. Food is good and price is right
A popular zi char serving comfort food! It is too salty to me. That said it is an ideal restaurant to eat and drink with good buddies.
Delicious local food with reasonable price
Had a lovely Chinese New Year meal here. I like the authentic local feel to it and we were chatting happily with the staff in Cantonese.
Really enjoy Kok Sen. I’ve read a lot of reviews about having to wait a long time and the staff being a bit inefficient and impatient, but after going a few times, personally I’ve learned to understand how it works there (if you’re not …
Bad phone service as I wanted to call for reservation but I had been calling since 5pm and for 40 mins the phone engaged all the time???

Absolutely poor service. Food tastes good but if you wait for 20 minutes to get your order taken after seating, and another 45 minutes for your food to arrive, then that just ruins the whole experience. If ever you get the chance to be …
Worst service ever! Havent had such bad experience in a restaurant in a long time. Waited more than 45mins for the food. Each dish takes 10-15mins to arrive. When asked, waiters just brushed us off saying “yeah its a long wait”, no sorries …
Service is in consistent! Food is great but I believe that there is a lot of MSG used! Been to this place for more than 7 times but lately decided not to due to the service and taste
wet tissues are not free.
Great Tze Char place. Difficult to get seats during meal hours, especially for big groups but if you’re willing to wait a while, it is worth it. Especially enjoyed the prawn fu yong omelette.
Food is good
Good food in a hip area
Rude lady boss while we asked for fish pricing, she shouted and asked us look for the price instead.
Have dinner there on 4th January 2019 with a group of old classmates. After all these years the restaurant is standard and quality of cooking is still as good. …
Still one of the better cantonese cze char places around Chinatown/tanjong pagar area. Go early around 6pm to get a table or try to call to reserve. That&#39;s how popular they are. New comers can start with their menu recommendations which are mouth watering.
The general experience and atmosphere was a very positive one and the food was good. But I was disappointed in the service at our table. I felt like there was no effort to make the customer happy and I was even made fun of after not understanding the mumbled words of the service staff. I never experienced this before.
Good place to have a breakfast. Delicious food and coffee. Pretty interesting decor.
Excellent brunch and coffee and also very friendly. Went twice in two days!
Glad they moved to city area :) Finally get to visit them again. Coffee is good here. I requested for double shot, 5oz. Coffee came hot, strong and full of aroma. They have an excellent variety of brunch food as well. Sat at the bar counter and enjoyed my time there. When I visited yesterday, there was a collaboration with Tanamera coffee. So there was free tasting of their capsules. The owner/boss was really friendly and shared that they will start to serve dinner during Ramadan month. Food will be more African style. He even showed us the menu. I’ll definitely be back.
Super kind &amp; friendly staff + good food. What else you want?! Super highly recommended!
Muddy espresso is where it is at!
Ordered a coffee takeaway, it’s prepared carefully and nice, would like to try their brunch as well.
Scrumptious all-day brunch spread. My first visit. Great location. Good Coffee!!!
A nice ambience
Quick stopover breakfast while biking on a weekday morning. Attentive service, nice food and coffee. Had the Eggs Benedict and iced mocha. Nice. Prompt and attentive service.

Definately a great place to have a heart breakfast! Ordered Moroccan Baked Eggs and Home-made Beef Burger. It was so delicious. The sauce from the Moroccan Baked Eggs was so nice paired with Sourdough. The burger had a cheese skirt, so delicious and the beef was juicy.. Definately gonna return again!
Awesome place! Love the ambience
Love love love the food and ambience! Staff were helpful and friendly! Will be back for sure!
Waited for 40 mins and turned out the staff forgot to input our order. When making payment they added an espresso to our order but we actually didn’t order any drink lol
Service was slow even on a weekday. Tables after us received their food but we were told the kitchen was busy with orders which is not true as they obviously forgot to input our order.
Ordered muddy espresso but not impressed since it is just a ice latte. It’s alright. Price is average high range. Food is okay.
Best iced oat latte tested in Singapore Great decor and super friendly service.

Not what it used to be since they shifted. Ordered eggs ben and the hollandaise sauce (which used to taste so good) is now subpar at best. Also don’t understand the interior. The seats towards the back close to the “open” kitchen is very dark and weird. Lost a loyal customer
No customer service . Went here for birthday lunch but left because of such service. Not recommended
Fantastic coffee. French toast was amazing. Staff are lovely. Beautiful cafe.
Both signatures of French toast &amp; crab meat omelette were very disappointing. Don’t order ice mocha. Food was bad, place is very warm, feels like the aircondition is not working
The service crew is really attentive and friendly, and the cafe itself is nice to sit with friends for an hour or two. Food was average, their filter coffee was decent.
Came in around 10:30am and it was relatively full, so we sat outside. Such a lovely place with super friendly and kind staff. Their interior was organic and had such a warm vibe. …

Soft launch of the new place near Arab Streetd - the coffee and food is as good as I remember and there is a clean, interesting new decor
Staff not friendly and service far to slow ! 30 min to get 2 simple slices of bread!… No other drinks than coffee or tea. Not recommended
When you’re in Singapore and searching for a fabulous coffee this is the place to go, they understand coffee
Yes yes yes. Excellent espresso, served at the right temperature (can be drunk straight away) with nary a hint of bitterness and sourness. Smooth and creamy. Perfect
Best coffee ever!!! Staff is well informed and extremely kind And cooperative! I come here almost every week. Good food and good service!
Will really miss this place and can’t wait for the new shop to be open! Definitely the nicest muddy espresso around. Please come back soon!
I ordered Full Breakfast, and my friends had Waffle with Chicken Chop.  The poached eggs is poorly done as shown. Sausage is not nice. Bacon is not …
Always awesome.  The dishes are well crafted and balance. Coffee is also awesome.

Awesome place! awesome service! Loved the food there. Everything was just perfect. Glad I got there a little early and got a table without wait. Have heard great feedback from friends, finally got to try it and it was worth it.
Highly recommended with good quality food!
Not too bad, missus loved it
Good for brunch. Nice setting but hard to find a parking spot.
Awesome place for brunch and coffee.
carrot cake is moist and not too sweet, muddy espresso was good too. 3 stars because the cutleries weren’t the cleanest

Update: I used to only like the coffee here (their signature muddy espresso is good) and find the food unappetising. …
Tried their Jaffa coffee and it was super yummy. First time trying a coffee with a hint of orange. Really cozy place with friendly warm staff
Great vibe, great coffee, humble staff!!
Bad experience for a birthday lunch, made a reservation for 2 to have a quieter spot but seemed like they forgot about the reservation and gave us a spot right smack in the middle of the cafe where all diners and staffs kept moving back and …
Wonderful service. My 1st impression. Not hi tech, but truly hi touch. (So relieved it didn&#39;t have the typical scan your menu &amp; order which is absolutely robotic.) The staff talk to their customers which is truly lacking in the F&amp;B industry …
One of my favourite cafe in Singapore. Visiting often since I discovered it. Coffees and Cold brew is reliable, french toast is perfect. Menu evolving over time. Highly recommend

This is a yummy brunch place. I had the Eggs Benedict with perfectly cooked poached eggs. The matcha latte was great. They also had butterbeer with a maple foam. The staff were helpful, despite the café being crowded. Price wise it was about S$22 per person with a main and a drink.
Jan 2015
Great cafe 👏  been there today with friend to try their Mediterranean breakfast . Avocado was great,  toast was nicely toasted and the eggs is da bomb .Will consider going for their cafe workshop . …
Halal cafe. Closes at 6pm, so take note!
We had an amazing Basque cheesecake here! The long black was also above average.
finally got some free time for a bit of cafe lounging, i came here for a good coffee fix. was carrying my three-year-old -who slept in the car on the way over. upon entry to the cafe, saw a table near the counter by the wall with no chairs …
Chocolate orange mocha is da bomb!
Delivery review  Everything came packed and proper with no spillage. Love the hot chocolate and …
Nice place with good cup of coffee and delicious brunch menu
We went for just a coffee break. The hot lattee and cold brew was nice. Quite a nice place to chill out.  Halal place.
One thing i disliked is the egg in the eggs benedict keeps on getting smaller.
Kudos for refreshing water with fruits. Burnt cheesecake was also good and service was friendly. What I miss here for 5 stars - convenient chairs and some more space between tables.
Quaint
Use to be my favourite cafe to hangout due to the food and service but now the cafe turning from bad to worst. Bad customer service. Food taste awful. Coffee came lukewarm. Took too long for food to be serve. What happen?
It was alright. Maybe my expectations were elevated due to the good reviews, but I thought it just ok. Not bad, not great. I read rave reviews about their coffee too - it was above average. Parking was atrocious though. That would discourage future visits.
Not sure if this place has recently changed hands but really did not enjoy our recent visit, seems to have gone downhill. Out of stock of a lot of menu items and the food was very average, staff didn’t seem to know much about what they have available. Ice chocolate was just out of a bottle! Wouldn’t recommend.
Don&#39;t know did not come before
Don&#39;t know did not come before
Great food with fantastic service made us enjoy our sumptuous brunch! Kids, friends and family friendly place to hangout and enjoy breakfast, brunch or dinner. Good food options for kids and adults with hearty portions. Will definitely …
They took a reservation and I showed up spot on time. They refused to serve me food because their kitchen was about to close for an event. When speaking to the staff and the manager they didn&#39;t really seem to care nor didn&#39;t feel the need to apologize. Poor service it seems.
Cozy ambience,friendly staff.breakfast is ok and decent portion. Love their Turkish egg..the combination of Greek yogurt and Moroccan spice is refreshing to taste buds
My second time here. I remembered wanting to come back and try the other dishes in the menu but alas! They were serving limited iftaar menu of African fare - my girl and I found them really good, especially the eggplant, mackerel steak and the hummous. Looks like I will have to come back for the regular menu after Hari Raya.
Bad experience with the dry and poor ham and cheese croissant (see photo). The filtered coffee is good.
Awesome coffee
Extremely good service. The staff were friendly and pleasent to.  Had a lemonade with a shot of coffee, interesting flavor was surprised it worked …
My go to for good morning coffee. They also serve good dishes and always friendly service.
Great place when get tired of local breakfast and want to try something western for a change. Their breakfast sets are really good value and the cofee is the tastiest I have …
Good food, coffee with good service. Parking space nearby is limited though.
Small portion and overpriced. Unfriendly service.
Really disappointing experience with regards to reservations. They don&#39;t confirm reservations until last moment. Calling them is no use as they will just tell you that if it is confirmed, you&#39;ll get an email.
Hearty Full English Breakfast and a nice cuppa iced coffee. Cool ambience and welcoming staff. Cakes and pastries are delicious too
Cake and coffee are delicious. A …
My go to cafe whenever I need comfort food. Eggs Benedict and English breakfast are the best, but I’d suggest opting for brioche over sourdough. A must try is their signature muddy espresso, a fancier version of your typical iced latte. …
The food is great but had to wait 40 minutes to be served hot drinks and another 20 minutes for food (after placing the order). Such a long waiting time is not worth it.
Nice coffee place with minimalistic decor. Coffee is good. The lemon cake is quite nice. Unfortunately, the place closes at 6pm. Best to sit outside on an overcast day.
One of my many options for decent coffee and cafe fare in the neighbourhood. Coffee quality consistent, service was prompt and friendly. Moroccan breakfast was the usual above average level. Pistachio lemon cake was a delight to complete …
Nice place to hang out and eat
Service and food was good. Great experience, food was a reasonable portion and price. (Salmon benedict and Croque Monsieur) Coffee was decent too, had a hot mocha and a peppermint chocolate cold brew. will be back to try their mains next time.
Nice place to chill and chat. Nice coffee, food and staff!
Nice place for coffee and brunch
Great coffee and breakfast!!
We went to this place in 2018 and again today for a family Sunday brunch. We ordered a spread of English breakfast, Shakshuka, &amp; French Toast. We loved all what we ordered. I did enjoyed the black coffee that accompanied my Shakshuka. …
Not a bad place for brunch. Service might be a bit slow but food is reasonably priced.
Awesome breakfast meals. Everything well seasoned and spiced. Good cakes too.

Great place for breakfast and tea time awesome latte
The steak frites is damn baikkk.  Love the chocolate ganache. And the pasta and also the pennymess fries ! Love the staffs there !
Good food service 10/10
Good food and good ambience ... Very recommended.
Intimate and cosy cafe with pretty good food. Our only gripe was that the tea that we ordered came in this jar which was pretty to look at but really quite a small portion. Other than that, food and coffee were done well. The spicy and bold breakfast set came with coffee and juice so it was a good deal and quite filling too!
Great food as always! Staffs are nice as well! Just the carpark is a bit difficult around that area, besides that, it&#39;s always my first choice in the area! 👍 …
Very Scrumptious and very filling.
Excellent food and super excellent coffee.
Finally to have an enjoyable breakfast on a Monday morning at a rustic feeling cafe.. Rare moments. Anyway love the Strawberry &amp; Blueberry waffle ❤❤ We had Spicy n Bold, Folded Eggs with Crab and Chilli and Baby Chino …
Delicious Turkish eggs and one of the best coffee in the neighbourhood
Kitchen closed at 4pm! We should have come sooner!
Really cozy place. The ambience is really intimate and the staff are very friendly. They do their eggs really well. Perfect for brunch.
After we sat down and made ourselves comfortable, the staff made us move to a tiny table in a cold spot to make way for a family that came after us. It would have been perfect if not for this one incident. Just ruined the whole experience.
Excellent breakfast &amp; service! Thumbs up Guys!
Very bad service, mediocre food - I was there for brunch with my friend but came 30 mins early. They asked me to wait outside for my friend to come first before taking a table, which I found a rather strange request. After 15 mins of …
Food not too bad
A Hidden Gem .. a friend recommended we visit and wow, what an awesome surprise .. excellent menu, tasty dishes and exceptional coffee .. I&#39;m ready to relocate East to enjoy this place more regularly ..
We love it so much.. I really njoy my food. The tart choc is soft and rich with choc.. and ice choc not too sweet. I also take away 2 cakes.
Great cakes and awesome coffee.
Great coffee 👌 …
Yummy chocolate cake that goes very well with the flat white
Penny University is a nice restaurant in the East Coast road, Singapore to have a relaxing breakfast/brunch specially during the weekend. We tried the Nordic breakfast set menu from here and it consisted of; …
Nice
Nice ambience. Food is okay
Great service and awesome food.
Our first breakfast at Penny University.. We had A Full breakfast set and Karange Chicken and waffle.. Overall is a wonderful experience
Good food, good coffee, nice ambience - what&#39;s not to like?
Very normal average cafe food but the brioche toast (top left) was worth it! $8.50 for fluffy toast and a side of eggs and beautifully sliced avo. …
Food is excellent - very filling; good for brunch! The staff is so warm and friendly. I googled about Penny University and learnt that they have been operating since 2012. For an indie restaurant/cafe, to maintain high standards of service and food quality after such a long time is very impressive!

Ambience ok but lighting too dim. Food is okay only. Good to choose set which comes with a juice and a hot drink
The ambiance is nice but the food portion is a bit small and the coffee aint the best
Love the place and the food served was good. We ordered the shabshuka set and the full English, gobbled everything up 😂. Will definitely come back again. …
Crazy rich coffee. Indulge the espresso heaven. Why there is no upsize coffee give me upsize coffee! Add the upsize coffee!

Takeaway 5oz for a steal at $2 during the P2HA period. Delicious cup; nutty, chocolaty, creamy and sweet. Making times a lot better due to the current restrictions.

Portions are small but the price is also much lower than other cafes. Had the English breakfast but unfortunately the baked beans and bacon came cold, and had to add some toast, sausage, hashbrowns and beans as the original portion were too small.. so ultimately it ended up the same as other pricier cafes.. overall still a decent visit.
I had the egg benedict dish. It was quite awful. The bread served is the type bought from NTUC, I expect specialty bread since I&#39;m eating in a cafe, not NTUC bread! 2 slices of NTUC bread with 2 poached eggs and supermarket smoked salmon. …
Nice
Good food and nice for brunch
Always love this place. Good service and good food. Only that their drinks need to improve to maybe bigger cups or more variety.
Food is very nice 😋 and staff is very kind and very very nice 😀 …
An old favourite of mine when I lived closer. Good quality coffee. Only complaint was the slowness of service for takeaway orders, which should really be prioritised and done quickly. Otherwise what’s the point?
Almost a decade old and still serves the best coffee, and great speciality dishes too! You know this isn&#39;t an ordinary cafe the moment you stepped in. Loving the quaint ambience, interior, culture, mood and food, everything seems to fit in so well.
This place is a nice small place for a good brunch on a weekend. They open quite early which is nice. Easy to cycle here as well. The food is also very good and the staff are really friendly. Definitely worth a go. Their coffee is good too! :)
The Ramadhan platter is excellent! Loved the Tunisian seafood soup with crab, beef cheeks rendang moussaka and spiced cold milk. …
Enjoy the ambiance and ice mocha is good! Reasonable price.
In my opinion, good ambience. Decent lightings for chill out and not bright like some other cafes in hot sunny days. …
Service was terrible. Staff was rude. Place wasn&#39;t even full and so many of them behind the counter yet took over 15 mins for them to take our order. Each time we would try to call them, they would rudely tell us to just wait. Would not go back. Coffee also not so good.
The weather is warming up across the country as we move into spring, and  is pouring up a slew of refreshing iced treats. There are currently drinks on its ever-changing menu, and infinite ways to customize them. But, admit it: you&#39;ve probably only had a fraction

Nice, cosy place for Sunday brunch. No queue at 1:30pm. Prices are relatively more affordable than the newer cafes. Prices listed on menu are nett, no gst and service charge.
Great service awesome coffee super cool place to chill
I like the food here.  I usually go on weekdays if I want a quiet place to catch up on work when I had previously stayed in the east. …
Definitely overhyped. Long queues, food was mediocre, coffee was alright. Staff should at least have something on them so patrons can easily identify them.
Just had my breakfast with hubby.... very nice and delicious english breakfast i had for the first time. …
Coffee was good.
Good food, good coffee, lovely staff, decent prices. Turkish Eggs was great.
Was turned away on my birthday because reservation date on their end was wrong. Wife was really sure that she gave the right date I mean come on she can’t possible forget my birthday right? Anyway came at reservation time with hungry …
Chocolate tart nice and not too sweet.waffles was warm and soft.nice place to go on weekdays late afternoon to chill and relax.staff was nice and approachable
Excellent coffee and good food! My favourite neighbourhood cafe
Great food and place. Will recommend to my family
Thematic with nice ambience, great food with great service.
Decided to give this place a try after my yoga on a Sunday! Didn’t make any reservation but i was lucky to get a seat after waiting fr about 5 mins?  Ordered the hot mocha $5.5 and full English breakfast $16 as pictured. Mocha didn’t taste …
It was good .we enjoyed english breakfast only other dishes took very long to come n the orange juice was too sour .
The food is actually pretty good!
This is definitely one of the better places for comfort breakfast foods like oatmeal and peanut butter sandwiches. Their latte was delicious too. Will definitely return.
Great ambience, amazing food (especially the breakfast &amp; brunch) and of course excellent coffee and other drinks. Great place to drink a cup of hot drink, munch on some pastries and just chill/catch up with a friend or read a book.
Ordered the spice bowl set which comes with coffee and orange juice. The food was delicious however limited choices for coffee. The espresso was okay but probably bcos ive tasted other better. …
Good food nice setup. Parking problem.
Didn&#39;t have time for the food (which looked and smelt great), but coffee was excellent and staff very helpful and friendly.
Love the food and ambience.. will be back again....and again. Worth the trip..
good service and good food
Fd ok Seats ok Come early queue, not crowded ok …
Great food, great service and great vibes!!
Always decent coffee, never disappoints
Worth the price and time taken to travel down
The service was disappointing. We waited for quite some time for the table but that was fine. Once we were inside we were told that we could spend 1hrs-1.15hrs inside the cafe. We ordered the food at 12.43pm for one egg benedicts and …
Really poor experience!  They don’t seat you unless your whole group has arrived. So, if you are waiting …
Finally tried after passing by for years. The coffee is good! Everything else can put a smile on your faces as well.
Coffee was nice as many reviews already mentioned. Staffs were friendly but even though I requested them to serve the coffee with waffles and they servce the waffles after 30mins. …
Great experience with a very friendly waiter. Pet friendly with outdoor seating. Great coffee and food.
Great coffee ☕
Good coffee. Nice place for brunch and the staff is friendly :)
Coffee and brunch food at Penny never disappoint! My Australian stepfather said that coffee here was better than in Australia. Tunisian eggs are a unique addition to breakfast options. Pesto chicken mac and cheese is amazing, loaded with cheese, chicken is nicely crisp and juicy. English breakfast, eggs benedict are always good.

1) Espresso sux - chose premium beans that’s suppose to be bitter sweet but I tasted absolutely nothing at all. Too much foam and hence espresso temperature was compromised …
cosy ambience with relatively pleasant food, a decent selection of menu. definitely a place to go for your brunch 🍳 …
Nice muddy espresso
good ambience and friendly staffs
Coffees are so so. I usually go there often but I think I will no longer be a customer there as one of the staff - big sized wearing spectacles -  was quite rude to me.
Placed takeaway order thru whatsapp they informed us that.....Sorry, we are putting on hold our pickup as of now.You can come down and place a takeaway order instead. …
Great potential if they weren&#39;t so unorganized!! Ordered two coffees, only got one after over 15 minutes of waiting!! Ordered food and the toast was burnt! Coffee is great but not worth the wait!
Travelled all the way there in the morning for breakfast. And it did not disappoint. Food was delicious and coffee was nice. Got myself outdoor seating and people keep coming. So be sure to reserve or be prepared to wait for a table as it …
Great ambience, nice food and efficient service! Will come back definitely 👍🏻 …
Staff is very friendly and informed us kindly of last orders and what time the kitchen is closing. We were late to our appointment but staff still let us in before last order. Food is yummy and quite big portion. It only opens until 8.30pm …
Customer service is so-so but the food is delicious &amp; fulfilling
👍 place, good breakfast menu …
Menu was downsized due to covid. But the cakes were excellent, though espresso was rather diluted and not very impressive. But overall great ambience.
Had green curry macaroni, it was decent. Would come for brunch instead
Good food, Great Desserts, if you are a Cheese Cake lover don’t miss the Burnt Cheese cake.
Tried the waffle and folded eggs with crab &amp; chili, taste average. Coffees are good. Its a small cafe and it was noisy when I visited the place.
Nice atmosphere
Iced coffee was good. However, big breakfast and french toast weren’t that great. Big portion but lacks quality. Tables were dirty and sticky when we dined. Slow service due to the weekend crowd.
One of my top favorite cafes in Singapore. If there are no seats, it&#39;s a  …
Excellent coffee! Best latte I had in a while.
Delicious food and great coffee in a comfortable cafe environment
The reviews probably made me expect more so I was disappointed with my experience, not the most friendly/helpful staff &amp; the foods abit meh 😒 …
5-star cafe for their focus on food, coffee and service. Cakes and baked goods are also excellent. Tucked away in a trendy and also historical neighbourhood. Definitely worth a visit if in the area.
More like Penny Dreadful!  Service that is. I&#39;m sure the coffee and food may be good but we waited 45mins after being seated outside (even though they let another couple in before us - zero waiting system in place) and no one cane out to take the order.  Ended up leaving.  Some places just don&#39;t care about service I guess.
Cosy ambience. Small place due to crowd. Ok priced for the quality of food and coffee.
Quality food and drinks. Friendly service. Takes a while at Q
All time fav spot
Coffee is good. Had the cappuccino but it’s not on the menu. Smooth and creamy. We tried the waffles and it was crispy and soft inside. They have some good-looking cakes too but didn’t try them. However the ambience can get noisy because it’s a small place. Do note that parking is also limited.
Ambience is good.. halal place for breakfast, brunch, lunch &amp; dinner..  Apt for weekend coffee &amp; just to chill..
quite crowded during weekend, have to queue. Food - so so , big portion.
Queues on the weekend so be sure to come early to get a seat. Good food and portions large. Very fast service too and wait staff v good! Really enjoyed the visit. Will try to go again!!!
Love the coffee!
Better off going anywhere else.  Extremely poor customer service and crowd management from the boy at the door …
Love the latte here and French toast. Folded eggs with crab and chilli was pretty ok too. …
Not a place for you if you want to chill w frens in a cafe. The cafe limits you to 1 hour to eat. Service attitude is bad. Was there earlier but my frens have not arrived, the staffs ask you to stand &amp; wait outside before your frens come …
Nordic brunch set, so nice, strong recommend.
Gotta love this small little quaint cafe.
Really disappointing experience considering so many high reviews.  Summary: Food quality average (mint chocolate milk drink was amazing), service …
Parking was a nightmare.
Cosy ambience
I think you guys need to expand to more than one outlet. always a pleasure to eat here. the food ambience and your staff are great 👍 …
Great ambience, coffee, food and friendly staff! Really enjoyed the eggs benedict with salmon! The classic mac &amp; cheese was not bad, although portion was a little small. Tried the muddy espresso with vanilla pump, and it was really nice, …
Good food! And love the rustic vibe :)
First visit. A nice space, piccolo and burnt cheesecake were both first class (taste is subjective remember). Great name too and like the fact they present the history of the name . . . visit and learn more for yourself 🙃😘 …
Coffee is nice. Wouldn&#39;t mind going here again for breakfast/brunch
Reasonably priced, delicious food! Wife and I had the burger and mac &amp; cheese.. Food was well seasoned just right! Mac and cheese was not overflowing with cheese and that&#39;s a good thing! …
Very reasonable pricing! French toast was good and served with fresh fruits. Their iced drinks however was a little small but it still tasted good! would visit again!

Although we had to queue for abit, was served with the best service and goooood food despite the heavy crowd.
Cold brew lemonade tasted disgusting 🤢🤢🤢  Don&#39;t even know why it&#39;s on the menu, they should remove it immediately! plus, the price on the menu was wrong. Its not 6.5 but actually 7. …
Well I must say.   Coffee that you can immediately drink after they serve you is the way its supposed to be done. Coffee done right, milk not scalded and can be drunk without sugar. …
Feel. Like ur on holiday. Fulfilling food. Pricey though.
4 years later try this again, still below average coffee. Don&#39;t stay for anything else
Really cool place with exceptional service.
Good food and good ambience
Nice environment. Friendly staff and tasty cake. I found the coffee was quite weak compared to other &#39;proper&#39; cafes. If you like your coffee strong,  don&#39;t go for the largest size.
Excellent coffee, nice hipster vibe.
Delicious brunch place. They serve good coffee but it was confusing when they asked me about the size of the coffee I want (3 once , 5 once or 7 once ?!!!). Despite this confusion, I’ve tried the Turkish poach egg with bread. It was …
If you’re driving and can’t find a parking space, you might as well head elsewhere. Because if you arrive even a few minutes after the 10 minutes they hold your table reservation for (3 mins in our case), they would’ve gladly given your table away without calling which I thought was standard practice. Disappointing to say the least.
Great experience, nice ambience.
I’ve been here countless of times. Love the Mac and cheese. The chicken and waffles were good, not the best item on the menu but it’s nice to share and try! Forgot what the other dish was, but it was crab meat on sourdough bread. …
Nice ambience with pleasant people. There is a QR code for the menu on the table but it&#39;s not updated. After deciding our food, we had to go to the counter to place order; but was told the choice …
Really love the food and coffee, but parking’s an issue.
Good coffee. Good food. Easy on the pocket.
I really love the ambience and the food! They played nice music. Their toilet is also clean! …
Lasagna mac is nothing but a lasagna or mac and cheese. Oily, not good and quite expensive. I do not recommend this place.
Cozy little outdoor corner. Service staff were friendly and nice. Food was okay. Coffee served lukewarm, :&#39;)
Awesome food.
So far the best Café I&#39;ve been to in Singapore. And worth to come back here again. …
Cake was really good. Service was excellent.
Crowded, food was pretty average but priced OK.
Coffee and pastries are alright but the cafe is really crammed
food was so so... but Faris really impressed me with his impeccable service. My friend was late and we had to be separated for awhile. He was very understanding and accommodating and made sure that my friends and I could sit together. Thank you for your service, to whoever is in charge, Faris is an excellent employee 5 stars

Quaint little place
Food&#39;s good. Time limit for seating.
Wanted to use the entertainer app for our purchase, but we forgot about it for a moment and the cashier had already keyed in orders. Cashier refused to help undo the transaction although it&#39;s possible in POS systems, and when I told her …
Nice coffee and breakfast but long queue. In-shop aircond is quite cold.

Alright food. Nthg to shout about. Long queu on weekends
Always crowded, cramped, noisy. But the coffee is decent.
Great ambiance, full of charm. Best specialty coffee! Staff is very friendly and helpful
The cafe has a really nice smell of coffee and the food was good! Not many seats inside so it tends to be very full
Tried only coffee - wasn&#39;t good. Service was poor. Not coming back.
Sweet and accommodating
Nice cafe with excellent service! Had a delicious branch with my family over here. Price is extremely reasonable, hope they do not hike in time to come.
Good service and food Love the coffee there Will definitely visit again
Love the ambience and food. Friendly and nice staff.
Nice little cozy place, good coffee and good simple recipes. Try their Mac&amp;Cheese! Delicious! Small portions but prices are very reasonable. Service is good too! Will definitely come back.
Food was lukewarm but the coffee was good.
The breakfast/brunch options are delicious.
Expensive. But decent coffee
Good coffee with Friendly staff❤❤❤
Faris nice service! very patient explaining the situation to every customer when that’s limited slot and space, very caring and will go to every table to make sure all the customer being take care, nice working attitude!
Coffee is excellent. Guys are passionate and professionals. The only downside of the place is its location - in fact you willing to sit outside. It is just beside a traffic junction of Telok Kurau Rd and East Coast Rd.
This cafe is a gem, top notch service and awesome food that&#39;s presented so creatively, all that&#39;s Michelin quality. Burp, so full now. Great work guys, keep it up!
Ordered two breakfast sets and a cheesecake. Breakfast sets made from cheaper ingredients hastily put together. Coffee is not great. Not sure why the service staff refuse to make eye contact with me. Cheesecake is the saving grace.
Great coffee, cakes and breakfast, brunch and lunch options.
Good execution. Chocolaty/nutty flavour. They roast their own beans and use Meiji milk. Opened in 2012, it’s a pioneer of third wave coffee in the east of Singapore.
Nice little hideout with good food.
Loved everything about my brunch set, blue crab with fluffy scramble eggs surprisingly was quite filling. And that gula melaka coffee just made my Sunday! Their homemade icecream cookies is a must try.
Good food, good service and great coffee... nice place for meet ups...
Terrible service.
Halal coffee/restaurant, looks great but the service is incredibly unorganized and slow , food was ok but nothing special - especially not for the wait and the cost. I would look further for a better place
Spiked muddy.
Great coffee, delicious food and friendly staff! Love the ambient of the place!
Love the matcha latte must have
Came here on a weekend and had to wait a bit before getting a table. Food was nice and no service charge as well.
A legitimate cafe that makes one of the best coffee in Singapore. Try the Dark Matter blend made exclusively for Penny by Papa Palhetta who go way back in sourcing and grinding great beans! Baristers are generally consistent in baristering …
My place for comfort food. You gotta come early. Any later than 9.30 it&#39;ll be packed. Staff are helpful and friendly. Food is amazing, burst of flavours.
Had a great dining experience here earlier this evening. Manager Fariz was very courteous too and asked how our dinner was. A good place for coffee, especially if you are after a good ol&#39; magic!
Lively place. Slightly noisy. But great coffee.
Food and drinks are decent. The cafe itself is accessible and very pretty. However it’s not exactly study/work friendly in the sense that it can be very noisy
Great coffee and breakfast...
Great coffee with a really nice atmosphere.  Nice brunch menu and the Chocolate truffle cake was unreal ... allegedly ;) …
Small and cosy cafe in the east. Coffee was really nice and enjoyed their almond cake too
Great coffee. However, place is rather squeeze
Great ambiance. Good food.
Nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, wonderfully presented. Signature muddy espresso is lovely. Sandwiches are well filled and the cakes are amazing. Also larger meals and sunday roasts available. Takes cards.
Espresso milk 5.5SGD The coffee itself is o …
These guys really make a perfect coffee. If you get the skilled experienced baristers, they pack the coffee well and never ever burn the milk. This is by far the best white coffee IMO. Dark Matter beans from Papa Palhetta are my top …
very good coffee (service levels have gone down now)
Best mocha u can get
Had speculoos and earl grey tea cheese cake. Speculoos would have tasted nicer if it&#39;s chilled. Spiked muddy was not for me but my friend likes it. The affogatto with vanilla …
Was expecting it to be better reading the reviews Coffee was good Food ok not awesome …
Nice chill out
Coffee&#39;s alright but seems like standard has dropped. Given there are so many coffee places in close proximity, I won&#39;t come here specifically unless there is a need to.
Had the Turkish eggs which were amazing! Must have! Also had karage chicken and waffles. Waffles were great. Turkey bacon not so much. Chicken was tasty but more fried chicken than karage, which was still very tasty

One of the best coffee. Limited options but I guess they are really focusing on their coffee. :) Great place to chill and people watching.
Dusty furnishings. Crispy duck is sticky and sweet. $15 mac&amp;cheese but portion is like a kid&#39;s meal. Bechamel and cheese sauce is lumpy.
quite like the ambience. Good food too. Good place a slow weekend brunch.
Coffee in a nice setting... Just keeping it simple without too much complexity
Surprisingly a very nice small neighbourhood cafe to chill at. Just a little too dark for their indoor seating and lack of celular network coverage, but thanks for providing wifi for your customers. …
A variety of quality food, good service, all at a competitive price point. It seems that they were implementing a new system the day I visited, and it resulted in a longer than usual waiting time for food. This should improve gradually.
Nice ambiance, friendly staff, gluten free cakes and menu options. Good quality food and drinks, gets busy might be worth booking a table if you know your going for certain time.
Nice brunch spot but can get too crowded
Super bad experience!! The aircon was down. We are fine to bear with it at first! However we waited the food for an hour or even more ! And we have to keep goin to the staff to check it! And there was no compensation or anything ! There was …
French toast is totally drenched and drown in syrup so it became soggy while the iced chocolate drink is super duper light that doesn&#39;t worth 6 dollars for it (The 7-11 chocolate milk is thicker than this shop iced chocolate). Oh, and i …
Wooo... the decor and ambience of this place. Super rustic with a modern twist to it. Ordered the full english breakfast ~16Sgd. Yummy! Coupled with my latte.. perfect! Wanted the flat white though.. but unfortunately they don’t serve flat …
The place is conducive. I have patronised the place 6 times. The customers are respectful and not loud. Fast and efficient service.
Great coffee, great service
Best Cafe ever
Very crowded and some of the dishes was overdone. But truffle fries were awesome
Relatively cosy space with decent coffee.
Love the ambiance, great food and coffee.
Food is good but costly
Now has good dinner menu
Muddy espresso with cold milk is still tops
Muddy espresso with cold milk is still tops
Small space and waitor was confused with our order by saying the name of our drinks that is different than the menu . So so coffee and brunch.
Crowded and small space. Service staff looked overwhelmed and tired. Food was ok
Good coffee and cakes. For brunch go for the Turkish Eggs which are something different to the standard dishes you get everywhere.
Good cakes and coffee. It’s a bit pricey for the quantity of food. Average experience overall.
Good dining place. Highly recommend the beef steak, truffle fries and affogato ! Rustic ambiance is one of a kind. Great staff serving food. Will definately come back for the breakfast/lunch menu. Keep it up ! 😎👍👍 …
Tried their ice lattes &amp; a Roche cake...which was delicious! Nice cozy place, but parking might be challenging. Nonetheless, will head back another time to try their brunch menu!
Food is good but be prepared to queue during meal hours without reservations
Nice cosy place to chit chat and nice coffee
They serve some awesome coffee and staff are friendly. Some of the dishes not commonly found in other cafes.
Nice food and helpful staff
Great coffee and good ambience!
Servings not large, seating a bit squishy and interior a bit dark. Ok if you&#39;re into the indie cafe vibe but not really for me. Cake display looked impressive but carrot cake was overly sweet. Too much sugar in the icing and couldnt taste any cream cheese at all.
Absolutely loved the dinner menu. Food was delicious and presentation on point! Yet affordable for such quality. Kudos! Would definitely return.
Nice environment. But service can definitely be improved. And kitchen is closed in the afternoon till dinner time. So can&#39;t enjoy much food when I was there.
Things that we liked about the place: Music, Decorations, Desert, and Service. …
I love their mud latte (cold milk with espresso). If you are around the east coast, it&#39;s worth to try their co …
Cafe with reasonably good food.
The food is great, the coffee is amazing and the staff are outstanding. I’ve also attended an espresso workshop here with a very knowledgeable barista. Definitely a must for all East Coasters !
Perhaps the first hipster cafe in the east and still going strong.
Place very cramp but food was OK...
Great Espresso and a tasty selection of cakes
Love the Moroccan Baked eggs and Full Breakfast! The Affogato with Coconut Ice cream is da bombz! Its reasonably priced and staff were very friendly :) Would definitely go back again!
Brunch portion was good and price is affordable. Great hangout place with decent coffee. Bonus: free WiFi!
Service can be better for the price they r charging. Small portion for drinks which is underwhelming. The earl grey cheesecake tastes nice if u don&#39;t mind the gelatinous texture. Ferarro roche cake doesnt look fresh though taste was ok. Won&#39;t be going there back again.
Cool place.Food was good too. Had the House Salad, Tiger Prawns and Waffles. They hv a spread of cakes and coffee for u to pick..Thumbs Up!
Loved this place. Great coffee/juice options. Really sweet staff. Lounge vibe in a cozy cafe way. …
Fast service, great food and coffee
This is one of the best breakfast/brunch places in Singapore.  My most favourite is Waffle Chicken with Maple syrup, typical Canadian style. …
Interesting selection nice to chill. But FYI the kitchen is closed during the afternoon only drinks and cakes are served.
I dont know
Pretty cosy place but, if you head there on weekends and it&#39;s crowded, be prepared that they will have ran out of certain items on their food. …
Not bad. Cakes are a little dry but coffees are good.
Nice, cosy place for a good time with a pleasant lady
Took the bold approach and tried their Espresso with Rosemary infused tonic but i find it too sweet and the combination just didn&#39;t go well.
Used to visit, nice coffee and atmosphere.
Love their lunch menu, great selection and fair price. Recently tried their dinner menu, amazing food as always but not sure I can get behind the small portions. The man attending to us did mention that they were trying to incorporate fine …
Food looks good, dessert was okay but coffee was great. Overall...nice ambience , cool set of crew but overpriced.
Quality halal food &amp; refreshments
Food is too good. We loved it
Great coffee and kombucha!
Cozy place and good tasting food.
The Damage: S$30-40 for two  Vibrant industrial vibe cafe in the East Coast. Semi self service while the fare …
The coffee and the meal offered are okay. Just I’m not sure if this is normal that they served burned toast like that to customer. The bread was placed under the folded eggs, yet the taste is still quite obvious it’s overdone bread. That’s …
Good food, service, great tea but crowd too noisy.
3.5 stars, kitchen was closed when we were there but anyway we went for the drinks. White Cold Brew, Butterbeer and Iced Chocolate all tasted really yummy and balanced! Service not much, Cheesecake horrible, we all looked at each other after one bite each, cause it wasn&#39;t cold at all and taste not pronounced.

Went there for after dinner boost. The bottled coffee is good and I tried their afogato with coconut ice cream paired with gula melaka. The coffee are fantastic. Earl Grey cheesecake is good, but I am not a big fans of cheese so I am not …
Since there are not many cafes around, here is always busy. Phone signal did not work, probably because seats are surrounded by wall without window. Wifi is available instead. …
Coffee is beyond bad... hope they continue to improve on their craft :)  Milk was poorly steamed; microform is almost non-existent, coffee flavour is …
Ordered english full breakfast. Served minus the bacons. Notified them and they slapped the plate of bacon on our table while we were alrdy having dessert. Finally we were given $1.70 in exchange for the missed bacon. I would recommend rabbit carrot gun cafe. Value for money.
Nice coffee:)
Nice place
Love their breakfast menu! Serving time was a little long though.
Cant remember anything about it Really ..
Cant remember anything about it Really ..
Patronised this cafe today as my husband wanted egg Ben and since it&#39;s halal, we went there without thinking twice. He got his fix and was happy with the poached egg (ie. runny yolk) and tasty hollandaise sauce. Coffee was good; we had flat …
The French toast is really nice, and mocha too. Will definitely come back again and try other things
Great coffee, great place. Lived near it for so long and never thought to pop in. Huge mistake. Will be a frequenter. Also, they actually do some food and have quite a bit of space inside.
The perfect place to be on a weekend brunch with your loved ones
One of the cafes that made cafes popular! The coffee there does not disappoint and never fails to keep me going!
We used to visit this coffee shop. But we won’t visit again due to the poor service. Menu sets are not flexible, not allow to change from sunny side up eggs to other …
The Turkish eggs were very unique and super tasty! Although it didn’t look like much it was surprisingly very filling and I enjoyed my breakfast there!
Nice place to chill for coffee but hard to get a seat during the weekend
Nice vibe and good drinks
The black rice poke bowl that is vegetarian is nice and I like the espresso.
Great place for coffee! Good ambiance, love spending my time here :)
The food r hit n miss. The katsu chicken sandwich is great. The full breakfast isn&#39;t great. We had the muddy espresso n the caffeine isn&#39;t strong enough.
A very rustic feeling place, serving great food! The soft music makes it a very relaxing place to chill.
Good food and coffee but can get a little crowded over the weekend.
Love their food and coffee. Cant decide if I like the ondeh ondeh cake though. Bit into pieces of gula malacca. May be a bit too sweet for some pple.
The good - coffee was great. Had folded eggs with crabmeat and chili. Portion size was good though in my opinion, it could do with more crabmeat and chili. …
Came here once in May 2013 when they were new and wasn&#39;t impressed with either the food or coffee. Came here again today as we had just eaten lunch next door at Al Forno. We ordered 2 Muddy Espressos (iced coffee), 1 Spiked Espresso and the …
Their coffee is good! Egg Benedict was okay!
Superb coffee
Good coffee with nice ambience!
Decent price, pretty packed place.
really average food given the price. coffe was alright
Great atmosphere. Recommended for those who love their gourmet coffee.
Food and ambience was pretty good, enjoyed it :)
Nice place to chill and talk with free wi-fi access, air-con and free flow of plain water.
One of the best coffee around! Try their Muddy Espresso or 5oz coffee. Really good. Food prices are very reasonable too. You can get a good meal plus coffee here …
I&#39;ve heard praises of Penny University, however this was a pretty disappointing experience. For the price and portion, definitely many other better cafes out there. They&#39;re famed for their coffee, but coffee was just average. Would not recommend.
I had the spiked muddy (espresso with gula melaka) and I enjoyed it. Definitely a drink I&#39;ll order again. French Toast and Full English Breakfast are alright.
Penny University is an artisanal cafe born out of a love of coffee discovered in London. We source our beans from local roasters, serve specialist cakes and bread freshly baked daily in the area, support and collaborate with local bakers and aim to be a haven for people of the East Coast and beyond. *Muslim-owned
Coffee was not bad. But the iced options like iced chocolate, iced chai tea etc is all served from a glass bottle which is quite small. Food came very slow on a Sunday morning. And when it came, it was not hot, it had already turned cold. …
Highly recommended
Loved the ambience and new flavours of the food. Will definitely go again. The menu is original south European flavours. Usually crowded and getting a  place might be difficult sometimes. We waited 10 minutes to get a place.

Love the sandwich there! Very recommend of the Penny Vegetarian sandwich. Very crispy baked bread with well cooked vegetables. And the price is reasonable at $12.8 you can have a nice meal.  …
Had French toast and mint chocolate for lunch. The food was good and mint chocolate was superb.
Good coffee and waffles! Would recommend the muddy espresso with milk.
An authentic cafe experience. Great to finally have quality halal western breakfast grub. Coffee is intense and have a good aroma and acidity.
Food is so so. Suitable hangout pl for the teenagers and young adults.
Big fan of smoothie bowl and French toast!
Very nice environment  on a not-so-busy day. Good coffee
Came here on a blistering hot day for a quencher. The Sonic of expresso with rosemary infused tonic hit the spot :) nice rustic decor and good seating for all kinds of parties numbers.
Excellent breakfast choices
Nice food. But too long a wait for Saturday brekkie
Cosy place. Nice coffee.  The only problem is parking availability
Friendly staff. Parking is a headache, though.
All 3 dishes ordered came across quote promising initially but left me rather unsatisfied. The full English breakfast wasn&#39;t too filling. Mac and cheese had powdery cheese and the crab egg salad was more egg than anything else. Coffee and chocolate are decent.
great neighbourhood gem
great neighbourhood gem
Stumbled upon this spot during Chinese New Years when mostly everything was closed. They offer complimentary water in wine bottles — great for solo or small party travelers. The barista was also one of the friendliest during my stay in …
Great place for coffee and chill. Halal.
Great coffee,  too popular though (crowded). Halal certified as well if that is something you are looking for
Cool interior and friendly staff but that’s about it. The cold brew was so-so and the falafel I ordered tasted like mashed cardboard.
Great place for brunch with nice friendly vibes.   Family friendly!
Coffee was great. Atmosphere and friendliness not the strong point, a bit disappointed
Wonderful
Good food, drink, ambience but always too crowded.
The cafe is halal, the coffee is very excellent, and the sweet …
Amazing coffee
Nice neighbourhood place. Warm ambience and friendly staff let down slightly by so-so food. I had the full breakfast.
Nice food and good atmosphere. Friendly staff.  Prices are reasonable but can be very crowded on weekends and holidays
Coffee is dame nice!
Cool cool place, the mint chocolate drink is heaven and the bottle is gorgeous. The people are friendly. Just need to smile more ;)
nice brunch
Extensive menu with milk alternatives but food lacking in quality and served cold
Great cafe with plenty of healthy options
Absolutely love the ondeh ondeh cake here.
Great place for brunch with nice friendly vibes. Coffee was excellent and one of the most well-balanced I&#39;ve tasted. Prices are very fair and affordable, in fact quite a bargain for the good quality. Coffee cups are a bit smaller than your …
Good coffee and a place to chill out. Great atmosphere. Serve coffee straight from the nozzle.
A cozy cafe to catch up with friends. My sister loves the coffee there..While I do enjoy the the rose tea and cheesecake.
Standards have dropped way too much ever since the last time I was here. It used to be my favorite cafe serving amazing food at a decent price. …
Delicious food and friendly staff. Recommended to come via public transport or cab as there&#39;s very limited car park space around.
Decent coffee, but: - poor service, staff just doesn&#39;t care - terribly overpriced. $18 for two coffees and a brownie , anyone? …
My wife and I went to &#39;Penny University&#39; for brunch on 20/10/2018. We were on an adventure around Singapore looking for delicious a Halal Western breakfast place. The food at this cafe was 100% delicious; all the dishes were authentic, …
Comfortable and reasonably priced.
They work really slowly but the coffee is super good
Good place
Good place
Serving size is small, expensive for the portion and cafe seatings are messy and inorganised. Won&#39;t be heading back :(

Cosy cafe, very good coffee, good comfort food. Nice vibe and friendly staff. My go to place in Singapore.
Coffee, food, service...... first class! We just moved to the area. Will be back!
I had the truffles fries  Visual: 7/10 …
Nice place to have weekend breakfast or brunch. Try Turkish Eggs here.
Great coffee and chill vibes! Might get crowded even during nonpeak hours so be ready for a short wait!
Nint …
We often visit this restaurant on weekends. We like the food and coffee here but the service never consistent. It disappointed me sometimes. Once we had brunch there, suddenly the server came to ask us if we would like to change to another …
Serving quite small for the price paid
Fancy
This place gets too uncomfortable on weekends. They cram so many tables in one place. Food is okay. Using fave pay gets you some discounts. Was here on a Saturday when it was so crowded. Service was okay if not for a server who kept giving …
Good fusion food and reasonable price
Decent cafe with nice food. Vibrant atmosphere, good for catching up with friends.
Portions can be small, but the food is good
2nd visit here during our trip to Singapore and I must say I&#39;m mightily impressed by these guys. Coffee is by far the best we had over the course of our cafe hopping time in Singapore. Food is great, staff very friendly and they play good music! Feels just like home in Melbourne!
Long-established cafe and serving arguably the best coffee in the east, if not one of the best in Singapore. Had the muddy espresso which was really really good. Food was great too. Compared to other independent cafes I&#39;ve tried in …
+love the iced signature muddy coffee, the coffee taste is strong and tasted quite unique as a whole, worthy for a try! -but be aware of the small portion (you will probably get a shock) that you will …
One of the few good coffee shops in the east around Katong area. The other good thing is that they’ve been around for a while, unlike the many which open and shut down before you realize. This used to be my go-to place before Homeground …
Excellent coffee, great ambience
Expensive but worth it
Good coffee, food reasonable/ok
Love the ambience. Great food and friendly staff. Price is a bit high though as compared to the portion  but it is still average if ir ia compared to other cafes.
Nice atmosphere and affordable food with good service which is albeit a bit slow. But the good service makes up for it.
Great coffee. Ordering and service snaleish
The menu is overpriced. Quantity is low, but the quality is not that bad. Ordered beverages, but turned out to be luke warm instead of hot. Service is not that bad.. but the response is not so immediate as well. Asked for sunny side up …
Extremely slow service.  3 of us got our meals at different timings. The orders were placed at the same time, 3rd person was served after 45mins. Coffee way too less for a large size. It was peak time but knowing that numbers are high the management should have a higher service and kitchen staff.
Had a slice of their rocher cake! Like that it wasn’t too sweet :) nice coffee too!
Very slow service. I wait breakfast 35 min.
Awesome coffee!
Good food and nice ambience
Don&#39;t understand why the establishment can&#39;t accept Visa payments as compared to  the prices of your meals.
A great restaurant that serves Western Brunch food and great coffee at a reasonable price. Would highly recommended it as an affordable weekend brunch spot. Try their Turkish eggs! They are simply delightful!
Went there on a Monday. The service was so slow. The food took forever to arrive. The salad that came with one of our meal had 3 pieces of lettuces. My French toast took at least 20 mins after the rest of the food. The cutlery given was covered in food residual.
I am a regular at Penny. My favourites are muddy espresso, soy latte &amp; chia seed smoothie bowl.
Good coffee, pretty slow service. The breakfast portions are on the small side
Good coffee, pretty slow service. The breakfast portions are on the small side
Coffee cup is small and the overall location is small.
Good ambience
Best iced latte in Singapore
Excellent coffee off a simple menu. Food choices are interesting and mostly good. Pricing is competitive. It is rather small and fills up quickly on weekends, so go early or prepare for a bit of a wait.
Cramp place.  Beverage n cake below expectation. Dont know Wht is the hype all about Pple raving abt this place.   Definitely over rated.
It is a rather small cafe, but the food is great! The serving is more than enough, yet the price is reasonable that most dishes are less than $20. Water and napkins are self served. …
Great coffee and truffle fries
Coffee menu is kept simple and food menu is ok. Breakfast options limited. Coffee and atmosphere is nice, but I feel the place is too cramp
Fav coffee place near the house.
The tables are a bit cramped up. But other than that great ambience!
Yummy place. Stopped by because it looked interesting. No regrets!! Turkish eggs and Eggs benedict is excellent. …
Really good cafe. Coffee is top rate, and food is also really good. They&#39;ve put a lot of thought into the menu and design overall. Staff are also friendly and accommodating which isn&#39;t always the case in Singapore.
Very cosy restaurant although crowded. Food variety is interesting and coffee vey good. Try the Turkish eggs. It changed my breakfast choices!
Coffee, brunches, desserts..try anything on the menu, you would not regret..
Often packed on weekends, be prepared to wait!
Visited on 29/04 at noon. There was mould on the crème fraîche, so I asked for assistance and an explanation. Lady came back with a word from the kitchen that left me without confidence to dine there ever again: “it was not mould, the chef …
An amazing place with great coffee. A bit cramped if you were to arrive during their peak hours.
Awesome little cafe with great decor, great coffee and friendly staff! Would recommend to anyone looking for a cuppa in the area!
Modern food, cake and coffee also cozy place to meet up. Small space and quite crowded especially on weekend nights. I like the egg benedict and the chocolate drink. Better come earlier because at night their kitchen is closed so we can only order cake or drinks. Very limited parking space and 200m from bus stop.
Good halal Cafe with good eggs &amp; smoothie bowls
Good coffee
Had the espresso with milk (which was good). My friend wanted a long black but they did not have that as an option (which could possibly be more flexible). …
Unfriendly (rude) staff, no place to sit as single guests (&#34;students&#34; on a PC with headphones on, heads down) occupy all the larger tables suited for 4, no eating, nor drinking at the same time.  This place is ca$h only (or NETS).  Pricey for what you get + nobody greets you when you get in or leave..yay!
The expresso with milk left an indelible msrk. It was very very good! 👍 …
Hipster place with strong coffee. Limited choices though and not very accessible.
Good food but rather squeezy.
I tried the French Toast and it was super Good! Recommend you to come:D
Best coffee in Singapore. One of the, anyway :) And a great Turkish Eggs dish.
Nice place
Nice place
Some of the best coffee in Singapore. Menu is halal.
Extremely slow service, mediocre food
Great ambience, love the lighting! Coffee is good too
Got my caffeine fix with their Muddy Espresso~!!
Was there on a late Saturday morning, full. Luckily we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for a table. Find the breakfast menu to be a bit limited, sandwiches are only served from noon😕. Food took quite some time to come, but didn&#39;t really bother us as we were cut chatting. Food is fine, not excellent though. …
My favorite is muddy espresso.
Our order taker was a bit blur and accidentally charged us for four main courses for a party of three. When the food came they refused to credit us for the additional main. I come here a lot and used to think that the hipster vibe meant that this place was a cut above other money-grubbing places in town, but no more. Such a shame.
Went for lunch, a bit so-so, didnt try the specialty coffee so this rating might be a bit biased
Some hits and some misses. The french toast was nice but too sweet!! The coffee was good and cakes too
Nice interiors with a cozy atmosphere. I tried Turkish poached eggs with yoghurt and marissa (a Moroccan chilli paste) which tasted very different and delicious. Their scrambled eggs are good as well.

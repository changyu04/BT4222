My linguine tasted like oil and the spaghetti is just like something you can get from a frozen spaghetti. Salad was totally like a mixed of  leftover vegetables.  4.

      "My second visit, no regrets and glad there's no longer a queue. We all enjoyed the eggslut but wish there's more toast to dig up the gooey eggslut. I'm not a fan of the truffle hash browns - too salty for me - but my group loved it!\n",
      "Lack of another star because of long waiting time, their coffee and the mashed potato not really that fantastic. Egg is nice but nth really special\n",
      "Loved the hand brew coffee, it was by common man roasters. Meal portions were small but tasty\n",

      "Our 2nd visit today (6/3/2022) at around 3pm. Queue was alright. We ordered fairfax sandwiches & hashbrown side & disappointed at how salty & oily the food was. We remembered it was much better back then when it just opened. …\n",

      "Very nice and delicious. Most importantly the portion is generous! We enjoyed it quite a lot also love the location. Ordered the Fairfax and Gaucho.\n",
      "Salty and soggy. Overhyped and price is not cheap for the food and drinks. No food I also will not eat again!!\n",
      "Had been hesitant to try Eggslut out due to hearing mixed reviews. However, I enjoyed both the Fairfax and Truffle Hashbrowns thoroughly! Well-seasoned, flavourful and not overly greasy. Already planning my next visit back!\n",
      "Don't understand what's the hype and queue for this place. Burgers are pretty normal and nothing great to shout of but cost between $12-$17 with just eggs + few pieces of bacon, sauce sandwiched between a bun. …\n",

      "Great touch to replace the brioche bun with arugula salad!\n",
      "Arrived at 12:55pm on a Saturday and waited for about 20mins to get seated. Food is consistently good (today was my second time trying Eggslut)! Their salted chocolate chip cookie was surprisingly good too.\n",
      "Extremely poor and double standard customer service! Customer directly in front of me is able to enter and wait for her friend in the shop but they told me they will only allow sitting once my friend is here?! Not consistent with their rules and simply thinks that I’m blind.\n",

      "Food taste meh. Wonder what the hype is all about. Not worth queuing.\n",
      "It is indeed a different style, but tasty. But only if you eat it as composed. If you drop certain elements it will be not the same. Clear, but for this kind of food it is even more significant. At the end, it is a good alternative to put in your fast food plan.\n",

      "Didn't have to queue for long at 1030am on lunar new year eve. Creamy and rich eggs on a fluffy brioche were quite flawless, the poach egg on mash is a winning combo. The hashbrowns arrive slightly soggy but the duck fat did make it quite yummy\n",

      "Sometimes I pay more for simple food elevated by premium ingredients and superb culinary skills. This time, I’m not sure what I’m paying more for. The Fairfax tastes really mediocre — totally not impressed with the cloying mushy scrambled eggs as well as the dry, airy and bland brioche bun. Overhyped.\n",

      "Went on weekday around 830pm. No queue at all. I ordered double beef patties cheese burger with add on avocado. Surprisingly the patties aren’t salty. But the patties and egg ain’t hot enough to melt the cheese. Hope they look into it. Overall, it’s a good experience and willing to visit again.\n",
      "Great place and the food is so so tasty\n",
      "Apart from the steep price. The food was absolutely fulfilling. Had the scrambled add on bacon and the egg texture was perfect and holds together with biting into it. The amount of bacon was adequate. The truffle hash brown is good\n",
      "This is a nice place and if you want egg in your food, this is the place! All the egg that you could get :p\n",
      "Lucky to dine in without queue. Overall, good food and service. Ordered fairfax with bacon and mini hashbrowns. Hashbrowns are fried nice and crispy. Fairfax would be better on its own. The additional bacon is too salty for me.\n",

      "So so. Expensive fare for whats essentially fast food. Not sure what's the hype about\n",

      "Great place, will visit the 2nd time if I am around the corner\n",
      "Worth to go and give it a try if there isn't any queue. Not the kind of food that I would stand in line for.\n",
      "To be honest it’s not so bad but $12 for an egg and bacon sandwich is really very fancy. On top of that we got 6 small round pieces of has brown for $4.50. You’re paying mostly for the hype and of course, cage-free eggs.\n",

      "Had the cheeseburger and topped up for bacon. Opt for bunless which they changed to salad. Love the beef patty! Food is good. Just find the bacon and truffle hash brown a bit too salty. But I like the idea that they offer you salad in replacement of the buns :)\n",
      "Finally visited this hyped up joint on a Friday morning. Took about 15-20 mins in the queue so that’s bearable though I can’t see myself queuing longer than 30 minutes to eat this. Good news is the food is very suitable for takeaway and you …\n",

      "An amazing place with great coffee. A bit cramped if you were to arrive during their peak hours.\n",
      "Awesome little cafe with great decor, great coffee and friendly staff! Would recommend to anyone looking for a cuppa in the area!\n",
      "Modern food, cake and coffee also cozy place to meet up. Small space and quite crowded especially on weekend nights. I like the egg benedict and the chocolate drink. Better come earlier because at night their kitchen is closed so we can only order cake or drinks. Very limited parking space and 200m from bus stop.\n",
      "Good halal Cafe with good eggs & smoothie bowls\n",
      "Good coffee\n",
      "Had the espresso with milk (which was good). My friend wanted a long black but they did not have that as an option (which could possibly be more flexible). …\n",
      "Unfriendly (rude) staff, no place to sit as single guests (\"students\" on a PC with headphones on, heads down) occupy all the larger tables suited for 4, no eating, nor drinking at the same time.  This place is ca$h only (or NETS).  Pricey for what you get + nobody greets you when you get in or leave..yay!\n",
      "The expresso with milk left an indelible msrk. It was very very good! 👍 …\n",
      "Hipster place with strong coffee. Limited choices though and not very accessible.\n",
      "Good food but rather squeezy.\n",
      "I tried the French Toast and it was super Good! Recommend you to come:D\n",
      "Best coffee in Singapore. One of the, anyway :) And a great Turkish Eggs dish.\n",
      "Nice place\n",

      "Got my caffeine fix with their Muddy Espresso~!!\n",
      "Was there on a late Saturday morning, full. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Find the breakfast menu to be a bit limited, sandwiches are only served from noon😕. Food took quite some time to come, but didn't really bother us as we were cut chatting. Food is fine, not excellent though. …\n",
      "My favorite is muddy espresso.\n",
      "Our order taker was a bit blur and accidentally charged us for four main courses for a party of three. When the food came they refused to credit us for the additional main. I come here a lot and used to think that the hipster vibe meant that this place was a cut above other money-grubbing places in town, but no more. Such a shame.\n",
      "Went for lunch, a bit so-so, didnt try the specialty coffee so this rating might be a bit biased\n",
      "Some hits and some misses. The french toast was nice but too sweet!! The coffee was good and cakes too\n",
      "Nice interiors with a cozy atmosphere. I tried Turkish poached eggs with yoghurt and marissa (a Moroccan chilli paste) which tasted very different and delicious. Their scrambled eggs are good as well.\n"
